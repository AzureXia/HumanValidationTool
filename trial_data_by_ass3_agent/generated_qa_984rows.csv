18842304,Do major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder confer differential risk for suicide?,"Although there has been a tremendous amount of research examining the risk conferred for suicide by depression in general, relatively little research examines the risk conferred by specific forms of depressive illness (e.g., dysthymic disorder, single episode versus recurrent major depressive disorder [MDD]). The purpose of the current study was to examine differences in suicidal ideation, clinician-rated suicide risk, suicide attempts, and family history of suicide in a sample of outpatients diagnosed with various forms of depressive illness. To accomplish this aim, we conducted a cluster analysis using the aforementioned suicide-related variables in a sample of 494 outpatients seen between January 2001 and July 2007 at the Florida State University Psychology Clinic. Patients were diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Two distinct clusters emerged that were indicative of lower and higher risk for suicide. After controlling for the number of comorbid Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, the only depressive illness that significantly predicted cluster membership was recurrent MDD, which tripled an individual's likelihood of being assigned to the higher risk cluster. The use of a cross-sectional design; the relatively low suicide risk in our sample; the relatively small number of individuals with double depression. Our results demonstrate the importance of both chronicity and severity of depression in terms of predicting increased suicide risk. Among the various forms of depressive illness examined, only recurrent MDD appeared to confer greater risk for suicide.",2009-May,Journal of affective disorders,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2008,YES,sa,"Which specific depressive disorder significantly increases the likelihood of higher suicide risk, even after controlling for comorbid Axis I and Axis II diagnoses?",Recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD).,"The abstract states that recurrent MDD tripled the likelihood of being assigned to the higher suicide risk cluster, making it the only depressive illness significantly predictive of elevated suicide risk."
18661116,[Transcranial magnetic stimulation for comorbid depression in anorexia].,"A 24-year-old anorexic patient with cormobid symptoms of depression was treated for depression with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) rather than with psychopharmacotherapy, due to her poor physical condition. The depressive symptomatology significantly improved in correlation with two rTMS cycles but occurred again within 2 weeks. A third successful cycle was then followed by a maintenance rTMS protocol with the patient going into remission from depression. This case illustrates that rTMS may be considered as a therapeutic option for comorbid depression in anorectic patients.",2008-Sep,Der Nervenarzt,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,"What treatment approach could be considered for a 24-year-old anorexic patient with comorbid depression when psychopharmacotherapy is contraindicated due to poor physical condition, and what strategy might prevent relapse?",Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) with a maintenance protocol to sustain remission.,"The abstract describes rTMS as effective for treating depression in an anorexic patient when medication was contraindicated.

18710785,Association between physical illnesses and depressive symptoms requiring hospitalization in suicide victims.,"We examined an association between a history of hospital-treated depression and physical diseases in 1877 suicide victims from Northern Finland. Information on physical diseases and depression of victims was extracted from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registers. Of suicide victims, 31% of female and 16% of male victims had a lifetime history of depression. When compared with victims without any lifetime hospital-treated physical illnesses, a history of depression was shown to associate with the diseases of the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems in the group of symptoms and signs, injuries and poisonings, and infectious diseases among male victims. Respectively, in female victims, an increased prevalence of depression was seen in endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, diseases of the nervous, circulatory, genitourinary, skin and subcutaneous tissue, and musculoskeletal systems, and with injuries and poisonings, pregnancy-related problems and infectious diseases. This study is the first to evaluate comorbidity between physical illnesses and depression over the lifetime in suicide victims; earlier studies reported findings in living patients from epidemiological or clinical populations. Since depression can affect quality of life in severely ill patients, targeting depression in patients with chronic illness may assist in decreasing suicide rates.",2008-Sep-30,Psychiatry research,Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,"Which physical disease categories are associated with a lifetime history of depression in female suicide victims, and how might this differ from male suicide victims?","In females: endocrine, nervous, circulatory, genitourinary, skin, musculoskeletal, injuries/poisonings, pregnancy-related, and infectious diseases.

18701169,Screening for bipolar disorder in a Spanish sample of outpatients with current major depressive episode.,"Bipolar spectrum disorders often go unrecognised and undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. One of the underlying reasons is the poor recognition of bipolar disorder among patients presenting depressive episodes. The specific aim of this study was to estimate the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) rate of positive screens for bipolar disorder in a Spanish sample of outpatients with a current major depressive episode and compare it with their current psychiatric diagnosis. The study was designed to address this specific question. 971 consecutively outpatients with a current DSM-IV TR diagnosis of a major depressive episode entered this cross-sectional study. Study measures included sociodemographic and clinical data, Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) and MDQ. 905 patients fulfilled criteria to be included in the analysis. All of them presented with a current major depressive episode. 74.3% (n=671) of the patients had received a diagnosis of unipolar depression and 25.7% (n=232) of bipolar disorder by a psychiatrist. Using a MDQ of 7-or-more-item threshold, the global positive screen rate for bipolar disorder was 41.3% (n=373). From the 671 patients with previous unipolar depression diagnosis, 161 (24%) screened positive for bipolar disorder with MDQ, whereas in 232 patients diagnosed of bipolar disorder, 212 (91.4%) screened positive for bipolar disorder. The MDQ showed a positive screen rate for bipolar disorder in 24% of patients with a previous diagnosis of unipolar disorder and a current major depressive episode. Screening tools like MDQ could contribute to increase detection of bipolar disorder in patients with depression. Early diagnosis of bipolar disorder may have important clinical and therapeutic implications in order to improve the illness course and the long-term functional outcome.",2009-Apr,Journal of affective disorders,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2008,YES,sa,What percentage of patients with a prior diagnosis of unipolar depression and a current major depressive episode screened positive for bipolar disorder using the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) at a 7-item threshold?,24%,The abstract states that 24% of patients with a previous unipolar depression diagnosis and a current major depressive episode screened positive for bipolar disorder using the MDQ at the specified threshold.
19341988,Light pressure massage for patients with severe anxiety.,"Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is common in the western world with a lifetime prevalence of 4.3 to 5.9% and is twice as common in women as in men. GAD can have a decisive impact on a patient's everyday life as it is surrounded by unfocused worries and the severe anxiety may interfere with normal social functions. The treatments include cognitive behavioural therapy and/or psychopharmacological drugs. In previous studies the positive effects of massage on anxiety have been shown. The present study described the experience of receiving massage for eight patients with GAD. Findings revealed that the patients were able to rediscover their own capacity during the massage period. This was illuminated by the experience of being relaxed in body and mind, the experience of unconditional attention, the experience of decreased anxiety and the experience of increased self-confidence. The paper ends with a discussion of clinical implications.",2009-May,Complementary therapies in clinical practice,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2008,YES,sa,"What psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatments are typically used for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and how might adjunctive therapies like massage contribute to symptom improvement?","Cognitive behavioral therapy and/or psychopharmacological drugs are standard treatments.

19135130,Nortriptyline mediates behavioral effects without affecting hippocampal cytogenesis in a genetic rat depression model.,"A prevailing hypothesis is that neurogenesis is reduced in depression and that the common mechanism for antidepressant treatments is to increase it in adult hippocampus. Reduced neurogenesis has been shown in healthy rats exposed to stress, but it has not yet been demonstrated in depressed patients. Emerging studies now indicate that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can, exert behavioral effects without affecting neurogenesis in mice. Here we extend our previous findings demonstrating that the number of BrdU positive cells in hippocampus was significantly higher in a rat model of depression, the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) compared to the control strain the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL). We also show that chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline exerts behavioral effects in the Porsolt forced swim test without affecting hippocampal cell proliferation in the FSL model. These results strengthen the arguments against hypothesis of neurogenesis being necessary in etiology of depression and as requisite for effects of antidepressants, and illustrate the importance of using a disease model and not healthy animals to assess effects of potential therapies for major depressive disorder.",2009-Feb-20,Neuroscience letters,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2008,YES,sa,How does the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat model challenge the hypothesis that reduced neurogenesis is necessary for depression and antidepressant efficacy?,"The FSL model shows increased hippocampal neurogenesis despite depressive behavior, and nortriptyline improves behavior without affecting neurogenesis.","The abstract states that FSL rats exhibit higher hippocampal neurogenesis compared to controls, yet display depressive behaviors. Additionally, nortriptyline's behavioral effects occur without altering neurogenesis, contradicting the hypothesis that reduced neurogenesis is necessary for depression or antidepressant efficacy."
18844643,Postpartum physical symptoms in new mothers: their relationship to functional limitations and emotional well-being.,"Postpartum physical health problems are common and have been understudied. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the associations among reported physical symptoms, functional limitations, and emotional well-being of postpartum women. The study included data from interviews conducted at 9 to 12 months postpartum from 1,323 women who had received prenatal care at nine community health centers located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, between February 2000 and November 2002. Emotional well-being was assessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and perceived emotional health. Functional limitations measures were related to child care, daily activities (housework and shopping), and employment. A summary measure of postpartum morbidity burden was constructed from a checklist of potential health problems typically associated with the postpartum period, such as backaches, abdominal pain, and dyspareunia. More than two-thirds (69%) of the women reported experiencing at least one physical health problem since childbirth. Forty-five percent reported at least one problem of moderate or major (as opposed to minor) severity and 20 percent reported at least one problem of major severity. The presence, severity, and cumulative morbidity burden associated with postpartum health problems were consistently correlated with reports of one or more functional limitations and measures of emotional well-being including depressive symptomatology. Although physical problems typically associated with the postpartum period are often regarded as transient or comparatively minor, they are strongly related both to women's functional impairment and to poor emotional health. Careful assessment of the physical, functional, and emotional health status of women in the year after childbirth may improve the quality of postpartum care.",2008-Sep,"Birth (Berkeley, Calif.)","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2008,YES,sa,How can postpartum physical health problems contribute to the development or exacerbation of depressive symptoms in new mothers?,"Postpartum physical health problems can impair functional abilities (e.g., child care, daily tasks) and are strongly correlated with depressive symptomatology and poor emotional well-being.","The abstract highlights that postpartum physical health problems are associated with functional limitations and depressive symptoms. These physical issues, especially when severe, impair daily functioning and emotional health, increasing the risk for depression."
18986657,Using longitudinal data from a clinical trial in depression to assess the reliability of its outcome scales.,"Longitudinal studies are permeating clinical trials in psychiatry. Additionally, in the same field, rating scales are frequently used to evaluate the status of the patients and the efficacy of new therapeutic procedures. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study the psychometric properties of these instruments within a longitudinal framework. In the area of depression, the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) is regularly used for antidepressant treatment evaluation. However, the use of HAMD has not been exempted from criticism what has lead to the development of new scales that are expected to be more sensitive for change, such as the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS). In general, the reliability of these scales has been extensively studied by using classical methods for reliability estimation, developed for specifically designed reliability studies. Unfortunately, the settings customarily considered in these reliability studies are usually far from the practical conditions in which these scales are applied in clinical trials and practice. In the present paper, we assess the reliability of these instruments in a more realistic scenario thereby using longitudinal data coming from clinical studies. Nowadays, newly developed methodology based on an extended concept of reliability, allows us to use longitudinal data for reliability estimation. This new approach not only enables to avoid bias by offering a better control of disturbing factors but it also produces more precise estimates by taking advantage of the large sample taking sizes available in clinical trials. Further, it offers practical guidelines for an optimal use of a rating scale in order to achieve a particular level of reliability. The merits of this new approach are illustrated by applying it on two clinical trials in depression to assess the reliability of the three outcome scales, HAMD, MADRS, and the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA).",2009-Apr,Journal of psychiatric research,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Validation Study",2008,YES,sa,What are the advantages of using longitudinal data to assess the reliability of depression and anxiety rating scales in clinical trials?,"Longitudinal data avoids bias, controls disturbing factors, provides precise estimates, and offers guidelines for optimal scale use.","The abstract highlights that longitudinal data improves reliability estimation by reducing bias, controlling confounders, leveraging larger sample sizes, and providing practical guidance for achieving reliability in clinical trials."

18433513,The use of artificial neural networks to study fatty acids in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"The range of the fatty acids has been largely investigated in the plasma and erythrocytes of patients suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper we investigate, for the first time, whether the study of the platelet fatty acids from such patients may be facilitated by means of artificial neural networks. Venous blood samples were taken from 84 patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of major depressive disorder and from 60 normal control subjects without a history of clinical depression. Platelet levels of the following 11 fatty acids were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance: C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, C18:1 n-9, C18:1 n-7, C18:2 n-6, C18:3 n-3, C20:3 n-3, C20:4 n-6 and C22:6 n-3. The results were then entered into a wide variety of different artificial neural networks. All the artificial neural networks tested gave essentially the same result. However, one type of artificial neural network, the self-organizing map, gave superior information by allowing the results to be described in a two-dimensional plane with potentially informative border areas. A series of repeated and independent self-organizing map simulations, with the input parameters being changed each time, led to the finding that the best discriminant map was that obtained by inclusion of just three fatty acids. Our results confirm that artificial neural networks may be used to analyze platelet fatty acids in neuropsychiatric disorder. Furthermore, they show that the self-organizing map, an unsupervised competitive-learning network algorithm which forms a nonlinear projection of a high-dimensional data manifold on a regular, low-dimensional grid, is an optimal type of artificial neural network to use for this task.",2008-Apr-17,BMC psychiatry,Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,"Which type of artificial neural network is most effective for analyzing platelet fatty acid levels to differentiate patients with major depressive disorder from controls, and why?","Self-organizing maps, because they allow for a two-dimensional representation with informative border areas.",The abstract states that self-organizing maps provided superior results by enabling a two-dimensional plane representation and identifying optimal discriminant maps using just three fatty acids.

As part of the Healthy Minds Study, a probability sample of 2843 college students completed an Internet survey on mental health problems, substance use behaviors, and utilization of mental health care. Response propensity weights were used to adjust for differences between respondents and non-respondents. Major depression, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder were positively associated with cigarette smoking. Frequent binge drinking was negatively associated with major depression and positively associated with generalized anxiety disorder, and these associations were significantly stronger for males than females. Among students with co-occurring frequent binge drinking and mental health problems, 67% perceived a need for mental health services but only 38% received services in the previous year.

18281061,"Maternal, not paternal, PTSD is related to increased risk for PTSD in offspring of Holocaust survivors.","A significant association between parental PTSD and the occurrence of PTSD in offspring has been noted, consistent with the idea that risk for the development of PTSD is transmitted from parent to child. Two recent reports linking maternal PTSD and low offspring cortisol prompted us to examine the relative contributions of maternal vs. paternal PTSD in the prediction of PTSD and other psychiatric diagnoses in offspring. One hundred seventeen men and 167 women, recruited from the community, were evaluated using a comprehensive psychiatric battery designed to identify traumatic life experiences and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. 211 of these subjects were the adult offspring of Holocaust survivors and 73 were demographically comparable Jewish controls. Participants were further subdivided based on whether their mother, father, neither, or both parents met diagnostic criteria for lifetime PTSD. A higher prevalence of lifetime PTSD, mood, anxiety disorders, and to a lesser extent, substance abuse disorders, was observed in offspring of Holocaust survivors than controls. The presence of maternal PTSD was specifically associated with PTSD in adult offspring of Holocaust survivors. However, other psychiatric diagnoses did not show specific effects associated with maternal PTSD. The tendency for maternal PTSD to make a greater contribution than paternal PTSD to PTSD risk suggests that classic genetic mechanisms are not the sole model of transmission, and paves way for the speculation that epigenetic factors may be involved. In contrast, PTSD in any parent contributes to risk for depression, and parental traumatization is associated with increased anxiety disorders in offspring.",2008-Oct,Journal of psychiatric research,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2008,YES,sa,How does parental PTSD influence the risk of clinical anxiety disorders in offspring?,"Parental PTSD increases the risk of clinical anxiety disorders in offspring, regardless of whether the affected parent is maternal or paternal.","The abstract states that parental traumatization is associated with increased anxiety disorders in offspring, without specifying a differential effect based on maternal or paternal PTSD."
19046223,Association between depression and concurrent Type 2 diabetes outcomes varies by diabetes regimen.,"Although depression has weak associations with several Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) outcomes, it is possible that these associations are concentrated within certain patient subgroups that are more vulnerable to their effects. This study tested the hypothesis that depression is related to glycaemic control and diabetes-related quality of life (DQOL) in patients who are prescribed injected insulin, but not those on oral glucose-lowering agents alone. Participants (103 on insulin, 155 on oral glucose-lowering agents alone) with Type 2 DM were recruited from a large US healthcare system and underwent assessment of glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin; HbA(1c)), medication adherence and diabetes self-care behaviours, DQOL and depression (none, mild, moderate/severe). There was a significant regimen x depression interaction on HbA(1c) (P = 0.002), such that depression was associated with HbA(1c) in patients using insulin (beta = 0.35, P < 0.001) but not in patients using oral agents alone (beta = -0.08, P = NS). There was a similar interaction when quality of life was analysed as an outcome (P = 0.002). Neither effect was mediated by regimen adherence. The generally weak association between depression and glycaemic control is concentrated among patients who are prescribed insulin. Similarly, the association between depression and illness quality of life is strongest in patients prescribed insulin. Because this is not attributable to depression-related adherence problems, psychophysiological mechanisms unique to this group ought to be carefully investigated. Clinicians might be especially vigilant for depression in Type 2 DM patients who use insulin and consider its potential impact upon their illness course.",2008-Nov,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2008,YES,sa,"In patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, why might depression have a stronger impact on glycaemic control in those prescribed insulin compared to those on oral glucose-lowering agents alone?","Psychophysiological mechanisms may uniquely affect insulin users, amplifying depression's impact on glycaemic control.","The abstract indicates that depression correlates with poorer HbA(1c) and DQOL in insulin users, not oral agent users, and this is not due to adherence issues, suggesting psychophysiological factors specific to insulin users."
18569779,Screening for mental disorders in cardiology outpatients.,"The objective of the study was to compare the frequency of mental disorders in cardiology outpatients to the number of patients with psychological problems identified by cardiologists. In a cardiology outpatient service, 103 consecutive patients were asked to participate in the study. Of these 86 were included and screened for mental disorder with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) psychosis screening, the Clock Drawing Test, and the WHO-5 Well-being Index. The cardiologists were asked to rate the severity of somatic and mental problems in each patient on visual analogue scales (VAS-som and VAS-men). The current treatments, including psychiatric and psychological treatments, were noted, and the survival was followed for 3 years. Of the 86 patients included, 34 (40%) had a diagnosis of mental disorder. Eleven (12.8%) had major depression, six (7.0%) minor depression, six (7.0%) anxiety disorder, two unspecified somatoform disorder, seven (8.1%) dementia, one alcohol abuse and one psychosis. Three of the patients were in long-term psychopharmacological treatment. Although the cardiologists predicted mental disorder significantly better than chance, none of the patients was in relevant treatment for their mental disorder. At 3-year follow-up, 20 (24%) of the patients had died. Age and severity of heart disease predicted mortality, while the presence of a mental disorder did not.

17928040,Duration of ultrasonic vocalizations in the isolated rat pup as a behavioral measure: sensitivity to anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs.,"Neo-natal rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when isolated from their mothers and littermates. Clinically effective anxiolytics reliably reduce USVs, making this behavior a useful animal model of the anxiolytic potential of novel pharmacological approaches to the treatment of anxiety. Here, we assess the hypothesis that USV duration (total time spent vocalizing) is a more sensitive measure of anxiolytic and antidepressant efficacy than USV number by testing established and putative anxiolytics in this model. Negative geotaxis and righting reflex latency were measured to assess sedating properties. The benzodiazepines, CDP (1-10 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg), the 5HT(1A) partial agonist, buspirone (0.3-3 mg/kg), and the mGluR5 antagonist, MTEP (1-30 mg/kg), reduced USV duration at lower doses and to a greater magnitude than USV number. The benzodiazepines, unlike buspirone and MTEP, produced measurable sedation, but it was dissociable from reductions in USV duration. The SSRI antidepressants, fluoxetine (1-30 mg/kg) and citalopram (0.3-30 mg/kg), reduced USV duration more than number with no measurable effect on sedation. The tricyclic antidepressants, imipramine (1-10 mg/kg) and amitriptyline (1-30 mg/kg), had no effect dissociable from sedation. These data support USV duration as a more sensitive and useful measure than USV number in the isolated rat pup model.",2008-Jan,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,Which pharmacological class of anxiolytics reduces anxiety-related behaviors in neonatal rat pups without inducing sedation?,5HT(1A) partial agonists and mGluR5 antagonists.,"Buspirone (5HT(1A) partial agonist) and MTEP (mGluR5 antagonist) reduced USV duration without measurable sedation, unlike benzodiazepines, which caused sedation.

The lesion of the dopamine innervation was produced by the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine into the dorsal part of the thalamic reticular nucleus. The lesion decreased the number of TH (+) cells of the pars compacta of substantia nigra by 33%, without modifying the number of TH (+) cells in ventral tegmental area. The lesion increased the time spent by the rats on the open arms of the elevated plus maze and decreased the duration of burying in the shock-probe test. Both results suggest reduced anxiety. The loss of the dopamine innervation to the TRn decreased the number of rearings but did not significantly affect total motor activity, gait or motor coordination, as evidenced by rotarod performance. These findings suggest that dopamine in the TRn plays a role in fear-related behaviour.",2009-Feb-11,Behavioural brain research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2008,YES,sa,What role does dopamine in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRn) appear to play in modulating anxiety-related behaviors?,Dopamine in the TRn appears to increase anxiety-related behaviors.,"Lesioning dopamine innervation in the TRn reduced anxiety markers, as evidenced by increased time on open arms in the elevated plus maze and decreased burying behavior in the shock-probe test, suggesting dopamine's role in promoting anxiety-related behaviors."
17487225,Behavioral and neurochemical alterations in mice deficient in anaplastic lymphoma kinase suggest therapeutic potential for psychiatric indications.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase product of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene has been implicated in oncogenesis as a product of several chromosomal translocations, although its endogeneous role in the hematopoietic and neural systems has remained poorly understood. We describe that the generation of animals homozygous for a deletion of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain leads to alterations in adult brain function. Evaluation of adult ALK homozygotes (HOs) revealed an age-dependent increase in basal hippocampal progenitor proliferation and alterations in behavioral tests consistent with a role for this receptor in the adult brain. ALK HO animals displayed an increased struggle time in the tail suspension test and the Porsolt swim test and enhanced performance in a novel object-recognition test. Neurochemical analysis demonstrates an increase in basal dopaminergic signalling selectively within the frontal cortex. Altogether, these results suggest that ALK functions in the adult brain to regulate the function of the frontal cortex and hippocampus and identifies ALK as a new target for psychiatric indications, such as schizophrenia and depression, with an underlying deregulated monoaminergic signalling.",2008-Feb,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,Which neurochemical alteration in the frontal cortex might represent a therapeutic target for treating depression based on receptor tyrosine kinase involvement?,Increased basal dopaminergic signaling.,"The abstract identifies elevated basal dopaminergic signaling in the frontal cortex of ALK homozygotes, suggesting ALK's role in regulating monoaminergic signaling linked to psychiatric conditions like depression."
17637604,Importance of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide in the central nucleus of amygdala in anxiogenic responses induced by ethanol withdrawal.,"We studied the involvement of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide (CART) in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA), lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTl) and nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) in generation of ethanol withdrawal symptoms, with particular focus on anxiety-like behavior using a social interaction test. Administration of CART (54-102) into the lateral ventricle (50 and 100 ng) and bilaterally in the CeA (10 and 20 ng) caused a significant reduction in social interaction, suggesting an anxiogenic action of the peptide. Chronic ethanol treatment for 15 days followed by withdrawal precipitated an anxiogenic response at 24 h that was attenuated by intracerebroventricular (5 mul) and intra-CeA (1 mul) administration of antibodies against CART (1 : 500 dilution). An immunocytochemistry protocol was employed to study the response of the endogenous CART system in the CeA following chronic ethanol withdrawal. At 0 h ethanol withdrawal, CART immunoreactivity was apparent in few fibers and the profile was similar to that in the pair-fed control rats. Twenty-four hours following ethanol withdrawal, a highly significant increase (P<0.001) in CART immunoreactivity was noticed in the CeA, which returned to normal 48 and 72 h post-withdrawal. Similar doses of CART or CART antibody injected bilaterally into the BNSTl or AcbSh produced no response in the social interaction test. Furthermore, the CART immunoreactivity profile did not change at the post-withdrawal time points in each of these brain sites.

Comparisons between 73 hearing-impaired subjects and 96 controls, well-matched for socio-demographic variables, were performed using the HHIA, MOS 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and SFQ questionnaires scores and revealed that the former experience a higher level of perceived hearing handicap and a deterioration of health-related quality of life while investigating emotional and socio-situational domains than the latter (p < 0.005). While investigating the psychological distress dimension of the hearing-impaired subjects by means of the Symptom Check List (SCL-90-R), it emerged that they are more prone to depression, anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility than subjects with no hearing problems (p < 0.05). It is argued that the sensory impairment, with its associated disability, may discourage hearing-impaired individuals from exposing themselves to socially challenging situations, producing isolation that leads to depression, irritability, feelings of inferiority. The same psychological symptoms, on the other hand, can compound and worsen the picture by influencing social behaviour of the affected persons. Further prospective studies are needed to address this issue. Nevertheless, it is concluded that Audiology Services, despite the time and costs involved, should improve their diagnostic ability by exploring more areas of hearing-impaired subjects concerns in order not to overlook their potentially reduced psychosocial well-being.",2008-Apr,Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,How might mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss contribute to the development of clinical depression or anxiety disorders in adults?,"Hearing loss can lead to social isolation, feelings of inferiority, and avoidance of socially challenging situations, which increase vulnerability to depression and anxiety.","The abstract links hearing loss to emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, due to its impact on social behavior, isolation, and interpersonal sensitivity, compounding psychological symptoms."
18263683,Patient-reported and physician-reported depressive conditions in relation to asthma severity and control.,"Depressive conditions in asthma patients have been described mostly from patient reports and less often from physician reports. While patient reports can encompass multiple symptoms, physician assessments can attribute symptoms to a mental health etiology. Our objectives were to identify associations between patient- and physician-reported depressive conditions and asthma severity and control. Patient-reported depressive symptoms were obtained using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [possible score 0 to 30; higher score indicates more depressive symptoms]. Patients were categorized as having a physician-reported depressive disorder if they had the following: a diagnosis of depression, depressive symptoms described in medical charts, or were prescribed antidepressants at doses used to treat depression. Patients also completed the Severity of Asthma Scale (SOA) [possible score 0 to 28; higher score indicates more severe] and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) [possible score 0 to 6; higher score indicates worse control]. Two hundred fifty-seven patients were included in this analysis (mean age, 42 years; 75% women). Mean SOA and ACQ (+/- SD) scores were 5.9 +/- 4.2 and 1.4 +/- 1.2, respectively; and mean GDS score was 6.3 +/- 6.4. After adjusting for age, sex, race, Latino ethnicity, education, medication adherence, body mass index, and smoking status, patient-reported depressive symptoms were associated with asthma severity (p = 0.007) and with asthma control (p = 0.0007). In contrast, physician-reported depressive disorders were associated with asthma severity (p = 0.04) but not with asthma control (p = 0.22) after adjusting for covariates. Physician- and patient-reported depressive conditions were associated with asthma severity. In contrast, patient-reported depressive symptoms were more closely associated with asthma control than were physician-reported depressive disorders. Identifying associations between depressive conditions and asthma severity and control is necessary to concurrently treat these conditions in this population.

19106378,Association between metabolic syndrome and depressive symptoms in middle-aged adults: results from the Whitehall II study.,"Although it is possible that the association between depression and the metabolic syndrome is a ""two-way street,"" the metabolic syndrome as a predictor of depression has been little investigated. We examined whether the metabolic syndrome is associated with the onset of depressive symptoms in a cohort of middle-aged British civil servants. Analyses included 5,232 participants (41-61 years of age) from the Whitehall II prospective cohort study. Depressive symptoms were assessed in 1991-1993 and again 6 years later using the depression subscale from the 30-item General Health Questionnaire. Metabolic syndrome was assessed in 1991-1993, according to National Cholesterol Education Program criteria. Presence of the metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of future depressive symptoms, odds ratio 1.38 (95% CI 1.02-1.96) after adjustment for potential confounders. Of the five components, only central obesity, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL cholesterol levels predicted depressive symptoms. These components explained most of the association between the metabolic syndrome and the onset of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that the metabolic syndrome, in particular the obesity and dyslipidemia components, is predictive of depressive symptoms.",2009-Mar,Diabetes care,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2008,YES,sa,Which specific components of the metabolic syndrome are most predictive of future depressive symptoms in middle-aged adults?,"Central obesity, high triglyceride levels, and low HDL cholesterol levels.","The abstract identifies these three components as the primary drivers of the association between the metabolic syndrome and the onset of depressive symptoms, based on their predictive value in the study cohort."
18690765,Strategies for identifying and channeling patients for depression care management.,"To determine optimal methods of identifying enrollees with possible depression for additional depression screening in the context of a care management program for chronically ill Medicare recipients. Observational analysis of telephone and mail survey and claims data collected for the Medicare Health Support (MHS) program. This study examines data from 14,902 participants with diabetes mellitus and/or congestive heart failure in the MHS program administered by Green Ribbon Health, LLC. Depression screening was performed by administering a 2-item screen (the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 [PHQ-2]) by telephone or by mail. Additional information about possible depression was drawn from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) depression diagnoses on claims and from self-reported use of antidepressant medications. We evaluated positive depression screens using the PHQ-2 administered via telephone versus mail, examined variations in screener-positive findings by care manager, and compared rates of positive screens with antidepressant use and with claims diagnoses of depression. Almost 14% of participants received an ICD-9 diagnosis of depression during the year before program enrollment; 7.1% reported taking antidepressants, and 5.1% screened positive for depression on the PHQ-2. We found substantial variation in positive depression screens by care manager that could not be explained by case mix, prior depression diagnoses, or current depression treatment. After adjusting for demographic and clinical differences, the PHQ-2-positive screen rates were 6.5% by telephone and 14.1% by mail (P <.001). A multipronged effort composed of mail screening (using the PHQ-2), self-reported antidepressant use, and claims diagnoses of depression may capture the greatest number of enrollees with possible depression.",2008-Aug,The American journal of managed care,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Validation Study",2008,YES,sa,What factors should be considered when interpreting variations in positive depression screening rates among care managers using the PHQ-2?,"Case mix, prior depression diagnoses, current depression treatment, and care manager-specific differences.","The abstract notes substantial variation in PHQ-2-positive depression screens by care manager, which could not be explained by case mix, prior diagnoses, or current treatment, suggesting care manager-specific factors may influence results."
18216276,Quality of mental health care for depressed adolescents.,"Understanding the quality of routine care for adolescent depression constitutes the initial step in designing and implementing improvement strategies. This study assessed depression detection and type and duration of services for adolescents in mental health care settings. Medical record diagnosis and standardized research interview results were compared for youth seeking mental health treatment. The majority of depressed adolescents received care consistent with guidelines and evidence. However, only 51% received appropriate medication; fewer than half received at least 8 sessions of outpatient care or follow-up after hospitalization. Males received significantly fewer components of quality care compared with females. Depression diagnoses in routine care may be facilitated by using structured interviews or questionnaires. Quality monitoring and improvement initiatives may also increase rates of care components that are consistent with guidelines and evidence.

17673299,Public attitudes towards prevention of depression.,"Various programs for depression prevention have been shown to be effective, but preventive efforts population wide are only beginning. We examine public attitudes towards prevention of depression and beliefs about helpful preventive measures. Fully structured telephone interview with a representative population sample including people of German nationality older than 14 years (n=1016). 75.4% of the sample agreed on the possibility to prevent depression. Of those, 403 (52.6%) stated that they would take part in prevention programs, and in this group 234 (58.1%) indicated readiness to pay out of their pocket for such programs. Out of a catalogue of 37 proposed actions, psychosocial and lifestyle related measures were preferred. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors--proactive lifestyle, relying on medicine, and relaxing--inherent in public beliefs about helpfulness of preventive measures. Higher education reduced willingness, high perceived personal risk of depression and previous contact to the disease increased willingness to take part in preventive programs. The public entertains favourable attitudes and beliefs about prevention of depression that do not conflict with evidence-based programs. Our study thus encourages implementation of population based prevention programs.",2008-Mar,Journal of affective disorders,Comparative Study; Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,What factors are associated with increased willingness to participate in depression prevention programs?,High perceived personal risk of depression and prior contact with the disease.,The abstract states that individuals with a high perceived personal risk of depression and those with previous contact with the disease showed increased willingness to participate in prevention programs.
18764967,Depression in multiple sclerosis: review and theoretical proposal.,"Because of its high prevalence and implications for quality of life and possibly even disease progression, depression has been intensively studied in multiple sclerosis (MS) over the past 25 years. Despite the publication of numerous excellent empirical research papers on this topic during that time, the publication of theoretical work that attempts to explain depression in a comprehensive way is scarce. In this study, we present a theoretical model that attempts to integrate existing work on depression in MS and provide testable hypotheses for future work. The model suggests that risk for depression begins with the onset of MS. MS results in disease-related changes such as increased lesion burden/brain atrophy and immunological anomalies that are associated with depression in MS, but explain only a relatively limited proportion of the variance. Common sequelae of MS including fatigue, physical disability, cognitive dysfunction, and pain, have all been shown to have an inconsistent or relatively weak relationship to depression in the literature. In the model, we propose that four variables--social support, coping, conceptions of the self and illness, and stress--may moderate the relationship between the above common MS sequelae with depression and help to explain inconsistencies in the literature.",2008-Sep,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,Journal Article; Review,2008,YES,sa,What are two biological mechanisms associated with depression in multiple sclerosis (MS) that explain only a limited proportion of the variance?,Increased lesion burden/brain atrophy and immunological anomalies.,"The abstract identifies increased lesion burden/brain atrophy and immunological anomalies as disease-related changes in MS linked to depression, though their contribution to the variance in depression is limited."
18973598,Chronic stress-induced alterations in amygdala responsiveness and behavior--modulation by trait anxiety and corticotropin-releasing factor systems.,"The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) plays a key role in emotional arousal and anxiety, and expresses high levels of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR)1. In rat brain slices, we have recently shown that afferent activation of the BLA is increased following application of exogenous corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). Here we examined the impact of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) on this effect of CRF and whether blockade of CRFR1 could prevent stress-induced changes in the electrophysiological response, the animal's behavior and in cell proliferation in the hippocampus. The behavior of the rats was monitored via a series of tests that formed part of the CUS. Electrophysiological measures of the BLA response to CRF, cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus and the expression of CRF and CRFR1 mRNA in amygdaloid nuclei were determined ex vivo after completion of the CUS. CRF-induced potentiation of afferent activation of the BLA was reduced in rats exposed to CUS, an effect that was inhibited by chronic antagonism of CRFR1. Furthermore, the reduction in BLA response to CRF was correlated with the anxiety trait of the animals, determined prior to initiation of the CUS. These results implicate CRFR1 in chronic stress-induced alterations in amygdala function and behavior. Furthermore, they show that CRFR1 antagonists can prevent changes induced by chronic stress, in particular in those animals that are highly anxious.",2008-Nov,The European journal of neuroscience,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2008,YES,sa,How might chronic CRFR1 antagonism mitigate anxiety-related behavioral and neurophysiological changes caused by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)?,By preventing stress-induced reductions in BLA response to CRF and preserving hippocampal cell proliferation.,"The abstract shows that CRFR1 antagonists block CUS-induced reductions in BLA CRF response, which correlates with anxiety, and prevent stress-related changes in hippocampal cell proliferation, mitigating anxiety-related outcomes."
19011321,Perceived stress among male medical students in Egypt and Saudi Arabia: effect of sociodemographic factors.,"In Arab countries, epidemiological data about psychological morbidity among medical undergraduate students are scarce. This study sought to determine whether there was a difference in perceived stress levels of male medical students at Mansoura University, Egypt, compared with male medical students at King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia. The sample consisted of 304 male medical students in Egypt and and 284 male medical students in Saudi Arabia. The self-reported questionnaire covered four categories, including 15 items, on sources of stress (stressors). The perceived stress scale and hospital anxiety and depression scale were used to measure stress, anxiety and depression. There was no significant difference between the two groups in number of stressors. However, Egyptian students were more likely to cite relationship, academic and environmental problems than Saudis. The prevalence of high stress was nearly equal in both groups. However, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among Egyptian than Saudi students. A logistic regression analysis of independent predictors of severe stress among both groups combined revealed that a satisfactory family income and university-graduated father were independent protective factors. The independent risk predictors were anxiety and number of stressors. Stress, anxiety and depression are frequent among medical students. Counseling and preventive mental health services should be an integral part of the routine clinical facilities caring for medical students.",2008,Annals of Saudi medicine,Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,What independent protective factors can reduce the risk of severe stress among male medical students in Arab countries?,Satisfactory family income and a university-graduated father.,The abstract identifies these factors as independent protective predictors against severe stress in male medical students based on logistic regression analysis.
19108731,Impact of demographic factors on recognition of persons with depression and anxiety in primary care in Slovenia.,"Research has repeatedly shown that family physicians fail to diagnose up to 70% of patients with common mental disorders. Objective of the study is to investigate associations between persons' gender, age and educational level and detection of depression and anxiety by their family physicians. We compared the results of two independent observational studies that were performed at the same time on a representative sample of family medicine practice attendees in Slovenia. 10710 patients participated in Slovenian Cross-sectional survey and 1118 patients participated in a first round of a cohort study (PREDICT-D study). Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of age, gender and educational level on detection of depression and anxiety. The prevalence of major depression and Other Anxiety Syndrome (OAS) amongst family practice attendees was low. The prevalence of Panic Syndrome (PS) was comparable to rates reported in the literature. A statistical model with merged data from both studies showed that it was over 15 times more likely for patients with ICD-10 criteria depression to be detected in PREDICT-D study as in SCS survey. In PREDICT-D study it was more likely for people with higher education to be diagnosed with ICD-10 criteria depression than in SCS survey. People with higher levels of education should probably be interviewed in a more standardized way to be recognised as having depression by Slovenian family physicians.

18477753,Social and economic correlates of depressive symptoms and perceived stress in South African adults.,"Adults in South Africa demonstrate rates of mental illness at or above levels elsewhere in the developing world. Yet there is a research gap regarding the social context surrounding mental health in this region. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the prevalence and correlates of depressive symptoms and perceived stress among a heterogeneous South African population. Low-income adults (n = 257) in Capetown, Port Elizabeth and Durban were interviewed regarding demographics, income, subjective social status, life events and decision-making. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) were used. CES-D scores were 18.8 (SD 11.7), with 50.4% of men and 64.5% of women exceeding the cut-off at which professional care is recommended (p = 0.03). PSS scores were 18.6 (SD 6.7), with a mean of 17.5 among men and 19.6 among women (p = 0.02). In multivariate regressions, increased CES-D scores were associated with more household members (p<0.1), lower educational attainment (p = 0.07), less income stability (p<0.07), lower subjective social status (p<0.01) and independent decision-making (p = 0.04). Increased PSS scores were associated with female gender (p<0.05), multiracial race (p<0.02), more household members (p<0.1), lower subjective social status (p<0.02) and recent birth or catastrophe (p<0.01).

18949460,Acid sensing ion channel (ASIC) inhibitors exhibit anxiolytic-like activity in preclinical pharmacological models.,"Acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated ion channels located in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Of particular interest is ASIC1a, which is located in areas associated with fear and anxiety behaviors. Recent reports suggest a role for ASIC1a in preclinical models of fear conditioning and anxiety. The present experiments evaluated various ASIC inhibitors in preclinical models of autonomic and behavioral parameters of anxiety. In addition, neurochemical studies evaluated the effects of an ASIC inhibitor (A-317567) on neurotransmitter levels in the amygdala. In electrophysiological studies using hippocampal primary neuronal cultures, three ASIC inhibitors (PcTX-1, A-317567, and amiloride) produced concentration-dependent inhibition of acid-evoked currents. In the stress-induced hyperthermia model, acute administration of psalmotoxin 1 (PcTX-1; 10-56 ng, i.c.v.), A-317567 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), and amiloride (10-100 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented stress-induced elevations in core body temperature. In the four-plate test, acute treatment with PcTX-1 (10-56 ng, i.c.v.) and A-317567 (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not amiloride (3-100 mg/kg, i.p.), produced dose-dependent and significant increases in the number of punished crossings relative to vehicle-treated animals. Additionally, PcTX-1 (56-178 ng, i.c.v.), A-317567 (0.1-10 mg/kg, i.p.), and amiloride (10-100 mg/kg, i.p.) lacked significant anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated zero maze. In neurochemical studies, an infusion of A-317567 (100 microM) into the amygdala significantly elevated the extracellular levels of GABA, but not glutamate, in this brain region. These findings demonstrate that ASIC inhibition produces anxiolytic-like effects in some behavioral models and indicate a potential role for GABAergic mechanisms to underlie these anxiolytic-like effects.",2009-Mar,Psychopharmacology,Journal Article,2008,YES,sa,"Which neurotransmitter is elevated in the amygdala following ASIC1a inhibition, and how might this relate to anxiolytic-like effects?","GABA is elevated in the amygdala following ASIC1a inhibition, which may underlie anxiolytic-like effects.","The abstract states that A-317567, an ASIC inhibitor, significantly increases extracellular GABA levels in the amygdala, suggesting a GABAergic mechanism for anxiolytic-like effects observed in preclinical models."

18177525,Vagus nerve stimulation for depression: efficacy and safety in a European study.,"Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy is associated with a decrease in seizure frequency in partial-onset seizure patients. Initial trials suggest that it may be an effective treatment, with few side-effects, for intractable depression. An open, uncontrolled European multi-centre study (D03) of VNS therapy was conducted, in addition to stable pharmacotherapy, in 74 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Treatment remained unchanged for the first 3 months; in the subsequent 9 months, medications and VNS dosing parameters were altered as indicated clinically. The baseline 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-28) score averaged 34. After 3 months of VNS, response rates (> or = 50% reduction in baseline scores) reached 37% and remission rates (HAMD-28 score <10) 17%. Response rates increased to 53% after 1 year of VNS, and remission rates reached 33%. Response was defined as sustained if no relapse occurred during the first year of VNS after response onset; 44% of patients met these criteria. Median time to response was 9 months. Most frequent side-effects were voice alteration (63% at 3 months of stimulation) and coughing (23%). VNS therapy was effective in reducing severity of depression; efficacy increased over time. Efficacy ratings were in the same range as those previously reported from a USA study using a similar protocol; at 12 months, reduction of symptom severity was significantly higher in the European sample. This might be explained by a small but significant difference in the baseline HAMD-28 score and the lower number of treatments in the current episode in the European study.",2008-May,Psychological medicine,Journal Article; Multicenter Study,2008,YES,sa,What was the median time to achieve a sustained response in patients with treatment-resistant depression undergoing vagus nerve stimulation therapy?,9 months,"The abstract states that the median time to response was 9 months, and 44% of patients achieved a sustained response without relapse during the first year of therapy."

Project ADAPT-Assuring Depression Assessment and Proactive Treatment-utilized existing primary care resources to overcome barriers to sustainability experienced by similar projects. This multifaceted intervention, which was structured after the successful IMPACT (Improving Mood/Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment) research intervention, used on-site geriatric depression specialists, clinic staff training, team collaboration, and depression practice guidelines to improve depression care for rural elders. IMPACT screening and assessment instruments and treatment protocols were modified for use by less highly trained staff already employed by the rural primary care clinics. Patient and provider depression educational materials and depression screening and monitoring protocols were provided by means of regional training sessions and phone contact. Evaluation data were collected by mail and phone surveys. Although Project ADAPT materials and training were initially developed for providers in rural primary care clinics, most participants came from long-term-care facilities, hospitals, home care, and public health and social service agencies. Forty-four sites sent 56 staff to Project ADAPT regional trainings, but many did not participate after the initial training.

Since opiate withdrawal is associated with increased anxiety in both humans and animals, this study aimed to investigate the possible sensitization of the neural substrates of fear in the midbrain tectum and its influence on the morphine withdrawal-induced anxiety. For the production of drug withdrawal, rats received morphine injections (10 mg/kg; s.c.) twice daily during 10 days. Forty-eight hours after the interruption of the chronic treatment, independent groups were probed in the elevated plus-maze and open-field tests. Additional groups of animals were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the dPAG or the IC and submitted to the electrical stimulation of these structures for the determination of the freezing and escape thresholds after 48 h of withdrawal. Our results showed that the morphine withdrawal promoted clear-cut levels of anxiety without the somatic signs of opiate withdrawal. Moreover, morphine-withdrawn rats had an increase in the reactivity to the electrical stimulation of the dPAG and the IC. These findings suggest that the increased anxiety induced by morphine withdrawal is associated with the sensitization of the neural substrates of fear in the dPAG and the IC. So, the present results give support to the hypothesis that withdrawal from chronic treatment with morphine leads to fear states possibly engendered by activation of the dPAG and IC, regardless of the production of somatic symptoms.",2008-Aug-20,European journal of pharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2008,YES,sa,How might chronic morphine withdrawal influence neural substrates of fear in anxiety disorders?,"Chronic morphine withdrawal sensitizes the dorsal periaqueductal gray and inferior colliculus, increasing anxiety by enhancing fear-related neural reactivity.","The abstract indicates morphine withdrawal increases anxiety and fear states through heightened reactivity in the dPAG and IC, key structures involved in fear processing."

However, precisely how m<sup>6</sup>A methylation is involved in major depressive disorder (MDD) is not fully understood. Circular RNA STAG1 (circSTAG1) was screened from the hippocampus of chronic unpredictable stress-treated mice using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Microinjection of circSTAG1 lentivirus into the mouse hippocampus was used to observe the role of circSTAG1 in depression. Sucrose preference, forced swim, and tail suspension tests were performed to evaluate the depressive-like behaviors of mice. Astrocyte dysfunction was examined by GFAP immunostaining and 3D reconstruction. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequence analysis was used to identify downstream targets of circSTAG1/ALKBH5 (alkB homolog 5) axis. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to evaluate astrocyte viability in vitro. circSTAG1 was significantly decreased in the chronic unpredictable stress-treated mouse hippocampus and in peripheral blood of patients with MDD. Overexpression of circSTAG1 notably attenuated astrocyte dysfunction and depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable stress. Further examination indicated that overexpressed circSTAG1 captured ALKBH5 and decreased the translocation of ALKBH5 into the nucleus, leading to increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) messenger RNA and degradation of FAAH in astrocytes with subsequent attenuation of depressive-like behaviors and astrocyte loss induced by corticosterone in vitro.

The Greek samples from ATTICA (2002-2012, n = 845 free-of-CVD subjects) and GREECS (2004-2014, n = 2,172 subjects with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)) prospective epidemiological studies with baseline psychological assessments were used for the first and the recurrent event, respectively. Depressive symptomatology was assessed at baseline, through Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale in the ATTICA study, and through the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale in the GREECS study. ACS as well as free-of-CVD women scored significantly higher for depressive symptomatology. Men scored higher than women against first (19.7% vs. 11.7%) and subsequent CVD events (38.8% vs. 32.9%). In participants with depressive symptoms man-to-woman first and recurrent CVD event rate ratio was below 1, confirming that depressive women were more likely to have a CVD event than depressive men. Multiadjusted analysis revealed that depressive symptomatology had an independent aggravating effect on the first (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.72, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.50, 9.12) and recurrent (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.01, 1.69) CVD events only in women. Mediation analysis in women revealed that 35% (23%, 44%) of excess first-CVD-event risk of depressive symptoms was attributed to conventional risk factors. The respective number for recurrent CVD events was 46% (23%, 53%); different patterns of ranking regarding the mediating effect corresponding to each adjustment factor were observed.

31944483,Trajectories of pain and anxiety in a longitudinal cohort of adolescent twins.,"Adolescence is critical to intercept chronic/persistent pain and decipher its association with anxiety. We ascertained adolescent pain trajectories, their demographic and clinical correlates, the longitudinal association with opiate prescriptions at age 19, and the etiology of the covariation between adolescent pain problems and anxiety symptoms. Longitudinal assessment of: 6 common pain problems at age 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 years; 7 common anxiety symptoms at age 12, 13, and 14 years; opiates' prescriptions at age 19, in the Quebec Newborn Twin Study birth cohort of 667 twin pairs born between 1995-1998. Analyses yielded three trajectories of: ""none-to-minimal"" (34.3%), ""sporadic"" (56.7%), and ""frequent"" (9.0%) pain problems between age 12-17. Anxiety (odds ratios [OR] OR<sub>age12</sub> : 2.38; confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-4.47; OR<sub>age13</sub> : 3.96; CI: 1.73-9.05; OR<sub>age14</sub> : 5.45; CI: 2.67-11.11), the female sex (OR: 3.69; CI: 2.20-6.21), and lower socioeconomic status (OR: 0.87; CI: 0.77-0.98) were associated with the ""frequent"" compared to the ""none-to-minimal"" pain trajectory. Only the ""frequent"" pain trajectory predicted opioid prescriptions at age 19 (OR: 4.14; CI: 1.16-14.55). A twin bivariate latent growth curve model and a cross-lagged model showed that genetic factors and non-shared environmental factors common to both phenotypes influence the longitudinal association between anxiety and adolescent pain problems.

An electronically search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI databases, WanFang Data and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals from inception to January 07, 2020 to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on five-element music interventions for prenatal, perinatal and postpartum women. Literature screening, data extraction, and the risk of bias assessment of all eligible studies were conducted by two reviewers independently. Then, meta-analysis was performed by RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 13 RCTs involving 2387 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that five-element music could significantly improve the depression levels (SMD = -2.03, 95%CI: -2.88 to -1.19, P < 0.00001), anxiety levels (SMD = -3.49, 95%CI: -4.47 to -2.24, P < 0.00001) and severe anxiety rate (OR = 0.42, 95%CI: 0.19 to 0.94, P = 0.04) of perinatal women. Additionally, five-element music produced significant effects on labor pain (MD = -0.67, 95%CI: -0.82 to -0.52, P < 0.00001), labor duration (MD = -0.85, 95%CI: -1.07 to -0.63, P < 0.00001), the hemorrhage 2 h after parturition (MD = -19.55, 95%CI: -35.56 to -3.54, P = 0.02) and the Serum DYN expression level (MD = 1.32, 95%CI: 0.23 to 2.40, P = 0.02). Five-element music may be efficacious in improving perinatal women' depression, anxiety, labor pain, labor duration, the hemorrhage 2 h after parturition and the Serum DYN expression level.

However, the role of miR-532-5p in depression remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of miR-532-5p in major depressive disorder (MDD). The depression mice model was established by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and confirmed by forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT). The role of miR-532-5p in MDD was detected by tail suspension test (TST), FST, SPT and SIT. QRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-139-5p in hippocampus and BV-2 microglia of mice. ELISA and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and MCP-1) and transcriptional activator 3 (STAT3). Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the downstream target genes of miR-532-5p. MiR-532-5p was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of mice treated with CUMS. Overexpression of miR-532-5p significantly reduced CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors and suppressed the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and MCP-1. MiR-532-5p directly targeted signal transducers and STAT3 in BV2 cells. In addition, overexpression of miR-532-5p restrained the raise of inducible NOS and IL-6, IL-1 β, TNF-α and MCP-1 in LPS-exposed BV2 cells.

However, pharmacological therapeutic approaches display undesirable side effects for patients, particularly when long-term therapy is required. Some evidences have suggested that <i>Coriandrum sativum</i> extract (CSE) provide sedative and anxiolytic effects. We investigate if CSE could attenuate anxiety-like behaviors induced by novelty and alarm substance exposures in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish were injected with vehicle, clonazepam, or CSE (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) and submitted to novel tank test. At the end, saline or alarm substance was added and anxiety-like responses were recorded. Twenty-four hours after, fish were submitted to the light/dark test. Novelty associated with alarm substance exposure decreased distance traveled and total time mobile in novel tank, and CSE (at 50 and 100 mg/kg) prevented these alterations similarly to clonazepam. Alarm substance reduced the time spent in white compartment (<i>p</i> = 0.0193 as compared with vehicle group). Clonazepam and CSE prevented this anxiogenic effect of alarm substance.

Circulating hormone and leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor levels, as well as leukocyte functional capacity, were assessed. AP was associated with lower DHEAs (P<0.05) and higher leukocyte GR expression (P<0.05). DHEAs was also negatively correlated with anxiety sensitivity (CASI, P<0.05). In conclusion, AP may have more predictive power than trauma in terms of health profile.

Cell culture studies reported that MGO could impair the glyoxalase, thioredoxin, and glutathione systems. Thus, we investigated the effect of in vivo MGO administration on these systems, but no major changes were observed in the glyoxalase, thioredoxin, and glutathione systems, as evaluated in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus of mice. A previous study from our group indicated that MGO administration produced learning/memory deficits and depression-like behavior. Confirming these findings, the tail suspension test indicated that MGO treatment for 7 days leads to depression-like behavior in three different mice strains. MGO treatment for 12 days induced working memory impairment, as evaluated in the Y maze spontaneous alternation test, which was paralleled by low dopamine and serotonin levels in the cerebral cortex. Increased DARPP32 Thr75/Thr34 phosphorylation ratio was observed, suggesting a suppression of phosphatase 1 inhibition, which may be involved in behavioral responses to MGO. Co-treatment with a dopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (bupropion, 10 mg/kg, p.o.) reversed the depression-like behavior and working memory impairment and restored the serotonin and dopamine levels in the cerebral cortex.

32011849,Low-Dose Ketamine Improves LPS-Induced Depression-like Behavior in Rats by Activating Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathways.,"About 16% of the world's population has major depressive disorder. Traditional antidepressants have slow effect rates and low response rates. Many studies have shown that low doses of ketamine can produce rapid and effective antidepressant effects. However, its mechanism of action needs further exploration. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to establish a depression model in rats and PC12 nerve cells were used for <i>in vitro</i> experiments. (2,4)-Dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine dihydrochloride (GTS-21), a specific agonist of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7 nAChRs), was used to compare the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. Different doses of α7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconatine (MLA) and α7 nAChR-siRNA were used to interfere with the protective effects of ketamine on neuroinflammation in rats and PC12 cells, respectively. MLA intervention downregulated the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine and decreased the effects of ketamine on behavior, synaptic plasticity, and Nissl bodies in the neuronal cells. Moreover, the dose of MLA was positively correlated with the inhibitory effect in rat hippocampi and the protective effects of GTS-21 were consistent with ketamine. These results demonstrated that low-dose ketamine could produce neuroprotective effects by activating the α7 nAChR-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in depression, resulting in a rapid antidepressant effect.",2020-Mar-04,ACS chemical neuroscience,,2020,YES,sa,What receptor pathway is implicated in the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine and how does its activation influence neuroinflammation?,"The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) pathway mediates ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects by activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), reducing neuroinflammation.","The abstract states ketamine activates α7 nAChRs, leading to neuroprotective effects via the CAP, reducing neuroinflammation and contributing to rapid antidepressant effects in depression models."
32539491,Safety and tolerability of IV ketamine in adults with major depressive or bipolar disorder: results from the Canadian rapid treatment center of excellence.,"Rigorous clinical trials suggest ketamine is safe and well-tolerated in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). There is a paucity of data on the safety and tolerability of ketamine in community-based clinics treating patients with TRD. Retrospective data was analyzed from 203 patients with TRD who received repeat-dose IV ketamine. Safety was operationalized as hemodynamic changes. Tolerability was evaluated through the reporting of adverse events and dissociation symptom severity, as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Ketamine was well-tolerated, with less than 5% of patients withdrawing due to tolerability concerns. Blood pressure significantly increased during infusion, with 44.3% meeting criteria for treatment-emergent hypertension (i.e., blood pressure ≥ 165/100 mmHg). 12% of patients exhibiting hypertension required pharmacological intervention. The most frequently reported adverse events included drowsiness (56.4%), dizziness (45.2%), dissociation (35.6%), and nausea (13.3%). Dissociation severity significantly attenuated after the first infusion, but plateaued for subsequent infusions. Intravenous ketamine was safe and well-tolerated. Hypertension was commonly observed and was often transient. Dissociation was most frequently reported after the first infusion but remained a consistent but not treatment-limiting adverse event thereafter.

30552507,Caudothalamic dysfunction in drug-free suicidally depressed patients: an MEG study.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), characterized by low mood or anhedonia, is commonly associated with a greater suicidal susceptibility. There are numerous suicide-related findings pertaining to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate nucleus and thalamus, which form a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit responsible for executive function and working memory. An aberrant CSTC circuitry is hypothesized to be implicated in depressed patients with a high suicidal risk. 27 MDD patients were assessed with the Nurses Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR), following which 14 patients were classified into a high suicide risk group (NGASR ≥ 12) and 13 patients were assigned to a low suicide risk group (NGASR < 6). All 27 patients were enrolled with 25 healthy controls for resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) measured the phase of alpha-band (8-13 Hz) as it modulated to cortical gamma-band (30-48 Hz). There was a significantly lower alpha-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the right caudate and left thalamus in high-risk suicide group compared to both the low-risk suicide group and healthy controls. The presence of a weaker coupling between the right caudate and left thalamus is indicative of a caudothalamic abnormality in suicidally depressed patients. This implies that a disruption of CSTC loop could result in executive dysfunction and working memory impairment, leading to an increased suicidal risk in MDD patients. In the future, this preliminary study has the possibility of being replicated on a larger scale, and hence validates caudothalamic dysfunction as a reliable neuroimaging biomarker for suicide in depression.",2020-Mar,European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,,2020,YES,sa,Which neuroimaging finding suggests a potential biomarker for increased suicide risk in patients with major depressive disorder?,Lower alpha-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the right caudate and left thalamus.,"The abstract identifies reduced PAC between the right caudate and left thalamus as indicative of caudothalamic dysfunction, linked to higher suicidal risk in MDD patients due to CSTC circuit disruption."
32584897,Threat of COVID-19 and emotional state during quarantine: Positive and negative affect as mediators in a cross-sectional study of the Spanish population.,"The objective of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of exceptionally stressful situations, such as the current health risk, on the cognitive and emotive state of the individual, that is, perceived threat and emotional state on affect and mood. This was a cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. The sample came to 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used. The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat. A negative affective balance increases both one's perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping.",2020,PloS one,,2020,YES,sa,How might the bidirectional relationship between perceived threat and negative mood contribute to the exacerbation of clinical anxiety disorders during a public health crisis?,"Perceived threat amplifies negative mood (e.g., anxiety), which in turn heightens threat perception, creating a reinforcing cycle that worsens clinical anxiety.","The abstract describes a circular relationship where perceived threat increases anxiety, and anxiety further heightens threat perception, potentially worsening clinical anxiety during crises like COVID-19."
32290813,Comparison of screening accuracy of the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 using two case-identification methods during pregnancy and postpartum.,"Variation exists regarding perinatal depression screening. A two-step screening method has been recommended. According to a maternity-focused core outcome set developed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement, women who score 3 or more on the PHQ-2 then complete the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Limited evidence exists regarding the screening accuracy of the PHQ-2 in childbearing women. An alternative case-identification method may be more sensitive for perinatal women. We aimed to [1] evaluate the screening accuracy of the PHQ-2 during the perinatal period using two case-identification methods, and [2] measure the variability of accuracy over four time-points during pregnancy and postpartum. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 309 consecutive women who completed the PHQ-2 and EPDS during pregnancy (booking, 36-weeks) and postpartum (6-, 26-weeks). EPDS was the reference standard using cut-off scores for 'at least probable minor depression' during pregnancy (≥ 13) and postpartum (≥ 10) and for 'probable major depression' during pregnancy (≥ 15) and postpartum (≥ 13). PHQ-2 was analysed using two methods: [1] scored (cut-points ≥ 2 and ≥ 3), [2] dichotomous yes/no (positive response to either question) against EPDS cut-points for at least probable minor and probable major depression. Receiver operating characteristic analyses determined accuracy. Probable major depression: Over four timepoints PHQ-2 ≥ 3 revealed lowest sensitivity (36-79%) but highest specificity (94-98%). An alternative case-identification method revealed high sensitivity (93-100%), but lowest specificity (58-71%). Minor depression: PHQ-2 ≥ 3 revealed the lowest sensitivity (19-50%) but highest specificity (95-98%). An alternative case-identification method revealed the highest sensitivity (81-100%) and moderate specificity (60-74%). Recommended method of case-identification (PHQ-2 ≥ 3) missed an unacceptable number of women at-risk of depression. As a clinical decision-making tool, an alternative, dichotomous method maximized case-identification and is recommended. Further, the literature identified inconsistent reporting of the PHQ-2 and the alternative case-identification method hindering the ability to synthesise data. The future use and reporting of consistent question wording and response format will improve outcome reporting and synthesis. Further research in larger and diverse maternity populations is recommended.",2020-Apr-14,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,,2020,YES,sa,Which PHQ-2 scoring method is more sensitive for identifying probable major depression in perinatal women?,The dichotomous yes/no method is more sensitive (93-100%) for identifying probable major depression.,"The abstract reports that the dichotomous method has higher sensitivity than the PHQ-2 ≥3 scoring method, which missed an unacceptable number of women at risk of depression during the perinatal period."

33086078,Mobility performance predicts incident depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Impaired mobility often co-occurs with depression. However, there is no systematic review evidence as to whether mobility impairments precede the onset of depression. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate whether mobility impairment could predict incident depression. A systematic search of cohort studies were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO. The target population was people with no depressive symptoms at baseline and follow-up for depression or depressive symptoms of at least three months. Of 1061 identified abstracts, 13 studies met the review eligibility criteria. The majority of included studies (8 out of 13) were of high methodological quality. Follow-up periods ranged from 12 months to 16 years. Gait speed was the most consistently reported mobility measure. Participants with slow gait speed were at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (pooled OR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.54 to 2.42, 11 studies).

33015831,Treatment of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) using video telehealth.,"Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of manual-based treatment for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), but access to mental health care still remains a problem, especially for patients living in areas without medical professionals who treat conversion disorder. Thus, we evaluated patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy for seizures with clinical video telehealth (CVT). We evaluated neuropsychiatric and seizure treatment outcomes in veterans diagnosed with PNES seen remotely via telehealth. We hypothesized that seizures and comorbidities will improve with treatment. This was a single-arm, prospective, observational, cohort, consecutive outpatient study. Patients with video-electroencephalography-confirmed PNES (n = 32) documented their seizure counts daily and comorbid symptoms prospectively over the course of treatment. Treatment was provided using a 12-session manual-based psychotherapy treatment given once per week, via CVT with a clinician at the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The primary outcome, seizure reduction, was 46% (P = .0001) per month over the course of treatment. Patients also showed significant improvements in global functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning, P = < .0001), quality of life (Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31, P = .0088), and health status scales (Short Form 36 Health Survey, P < .05), and reductions in both depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II, P = .0028) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, P = .0013) scores.

32905958,"Trends in anxiety among adults in the United States, 2008-2018: Rapid increases among young adults.","In a time of global uncertainty, understanding the psychological health of the American public is imperative. There are no current data on anxiety trends among adults in the United States (US) over time. This study aimed to investigate prevalence of anxiety among US adults from 2008 to 2018. Data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which is an annual, cross-sectional survey on substance use and mental health in the US, were analyzed in 2020. Prevalence of past-month anxiety was estimated among those ages ≥18, by survey year from 2008 to 2018. Time trends were tested using logistic regression. Anxiety increased from 5.12% in 2008 to 6.68% in 2018 (p < 0.0001) among adult Americans.

32714472,The Effect of Propofol on a Forced Swim Test in Mice at 24 Hours.,"There are few rapidly acting treatments for acute suicidality or treatment-resistant depression. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is an intravenous anesthetic agent used in outpatient settings. It is a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A agonist and has affinity at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Elevation in mood and sociality in humans has been observed following propofol-induced anesthesia. Other authors reported an open-label study of repeated dosing of propofol in treatment-resistant depression in which several patients experienced sustained improvement. Recently, we reported that in a rodent model of despair, a forced swim test, 45 minutes after administration of 50 mg/kg propofol, immobility time was significantly reduced. The objective of the experiment was to determine whether the antidepressant-like effects of a single dose of propofol in mice are sustained for 24 hours. The time spent immobile during a forced swim test 24 hours after intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of propofol 50 mg/kg or 0.9% saline was evaluated in 24 adult male mice (C57/BL6). Immobility time was quantified and evaluated with a custom video analysis software program. Propofol-treated mice were immobile for a mean (SEM) time of 115 (13) seconds, whereas saline-treated mice were immobile for a mean (SEM) time of 94 (14) seconds. A 2-tailed unpaired <i>t</i> test found no significant difference between the treatment groups (<i>t</i> = 1.07, df = 22; <i>P</i> = 0.30). Twenty-four hours after intraperitoneal administration, the effect of propofol on immobility time was not statistically significantly different from vehicle.

The aim of our study was to clarify the roles of Chr, Nar and Api in ameliorating depression-like behaviour induced by corticosterone. First, the behavioural and biochemical indicators closely related to depression were examined to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Chr/Nar/Api on a depression model. Then, a metabolomics approach was utilized to screen for biomarkers and related pathways between a control group and Chr/Nar/Api groups. The comprehensive results revealed that Chr/Nar/Api exerted anti-depressant effects through interfering with tryptophan metabolism, arginine and prolinemetabolism, citrate cycle, niacin and niacinamide metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. The mechanism of Chr/Api/Nar in the treatment of depression was elucidated based on material and energy metabolism. Moreover, Nar could be used as a substitute for Chr for reversing depression-like behaviour, and Api was similar to a positive drug in terms of function on depression.

The effects of the lay counsellor-delivered intervention were larger for most outcomes at 17-months follow-up compared with those at 8 months: school climate (effect size [ES; 95% CI] = 2.23 [1.97-2.50] versus 1.88 [1.44-2.32], p < 0.001); depression (ES [95% CI] = -1.19 [-1.56 to -0.82] versus -0.27 [-0.44 to -0.11], p < 0.001); attitude towards gender equity (ES [95% CI] = 0.53 [0.27-0.79] versus 0.23 [0.10-0.36], p < 0.001); bullying (ES [95% CI] = -2.22 [-2.84 to -1.60] versus -0.47 [-0.61 to -0.33], p < 0.001); violence victimisation (OR [95% CI] = 0.08 [0.04-0.14] versus 0.62 [0.46-0.84], p < 0.001); and violence perpetration (OR [95% CI] = 0.16 [0.09-0.29] versus 0.68 [0.48-0.96], p < 0.001), suggesting incremental benefits with an extended intervention. A limitation of the study is that 27% of baseline participants did not complete the 17-month outcome assessment.

32850269,The Role of Interleukin-6 and Inflammatory Cytokines in Pancreatic Cancer-Associated Depression.,"Pancreatic cancer is historically known for representing a challenge for both diagnosis and treatment. Despite the advances in medicine, science, and technology, it remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The association between pancreatic cancer and major depression preceding the diagnosis is well known; however, it is still poorly understood, being considered an obscure piece of the puzzle the disease represents. It has been characterized as a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by the dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6). Despite many types of studies describing the association, researchers have been reluctant to recommend it as a screening tool or early marker of the disease, mainly because of the non-specific nature of depression and anxiety in the studied patients. In this literature review, we aim to better understand the relationship between pancreatic cancer and major depression and characterize the immunologic mechanism of action behind the association.",2020-Aug-23,Cureus,,2020,YES,sa,What cytokine has been implicated in the immunologic mechanism linking major depression and pancreatic cancer?,Interleukin-6 (IL-6).,The abstract identifies interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the inflammatory cytokine driving the paraneoplastic syndrome that links major depression to pancreatic cancer through dysregulation of immune pathways.
32915660,Social Media Markers to Identify Fathers at Risk of Postpartum Depression: A Machine Learning Approach.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a significant mental health issue in mothers and fathers alike; yet at-risk fathers often come to the attention of health care professionals late due to low awareness of symptoms and reluctance to seek help. This study aimed to examine whether passive social media markers are effective for identifying fathers at risk of PPD. We collected 67,796 Reddit posts from 365 fathers, spanning a 6-month period around the birth of their child. A list of ""at-risk"" words was developed in collaboration with a perinatal mental health expert. PPD was assessed by evaluating the change in fathers' use of words indicating depressive symptomatology after childbirth. Predictive models were developed as a series of support vector machine classifiers using behavior, emotion, linguistic style, and discussion topics as features. The performance of these classifiers indicates that fathers at risk of PPD can be predicted from their prepartum data alone. Overall, the best performing model used discussion topic features only with a recall score of 0.82. These findings could assist in the development of support and intervention tools for fathers during the prepartum period, with specific applicability to personalized and preventative support tools for at-risk fathers.",2020-Sep,"Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",,2020,YES,sa,What predictive model feature was most effective in identifying fathers at risk of postpartum depression based on prepartum data?,Discussion topic features.,"The abstract states that the best-performing predictive model for identifying fathers at risk of postpartum depression used discussion topic features, achieving a recall score of 0.82."
32599612,Ashamed and Alone-Risk Factors for Alcohol Craving Among Depressed Emerging Adults.,"Comorbid alcohol use and depression have the highest prevalence among emerging adults and are associated with a number of consequences. Self-medication theory posits individuals with depression use alcohol to cope with their negative emotions. Preliminary work has investigated the social context of depression-related drinking and found that solitary drinking is a risky, atypical behaviour in emerging adulthood that is associated with alcohol misuse. However, it is unknown about what is unfolding in the moment that is driving depression-related drinking in solitary contexts. Accordingly, we used an experimental study to examine if shame mediated the association between depression and in-lab alcohol craving. Emerging adults (N = 80) completed a shame induction followed by an alcohol cue exposure in either a solitary or social condition. We used moderated mediation to test hypotheses. Consistent with hypotheses, conditional indirect effects supported the mediation of depression and alcohol craving through shame among those in the solitary condition, but not in the social condition. There was no support for guilt as a mediator. Our study demonstrates that shame is a specific emotional experience that contributes to solitary drinking among depressed emerging adults. It is important to use these results to inform interventions that directly target solitary contexts and shame.",2020-Aug-14,"Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire)",,2020,YES,sa,How might shame influence the relationship between depression and solitary alcohol craving in emerging adults?,"Shame mediates the relationship between depression and solitary alcohol craving, intensifying the craving in solitary contexts.","The abstract identifies shame as a specific emotional experience that mediates depression and alcohol craving in solitary contexts, but not in social ones, highlighting its role in solitary drinking among depressed emerging adults."
31529992,Associations of depression-anxiety and dyslipidaemia with subclinical carotid arterial disease: Findings from the Whitehall II Study.,"There is mixed evidence for an association between depression and/or anxiety and carotid intima-media thickness, and limited information on the related role of dyslipidaemia. Here we report associations between depression and/or anxiety and intima-media thickness in the Whitehall II cohort, considering the moderating effects of sex and dyslipidaemia. A total of 2822 men and 1112 women (61 ± 6 years) were studied during phase 7 (2002-2004) of the Whitehall II study. Intima-media thickness and lipid levels were assessed, and questionnaires (general health questionnaire and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies depression scale) were completed. Linear regression was used to explore relationships between depression and/or anxiety and intima-media thickness and the moderating effects of sex and dyslipidaemia. A total of 1461 participants were categorised with depression and/or anxiety. The association between depression and/or anxiety and intima-media thickness differed between men and women so analyses were undertaken separately by sex. In men, intima-media thickness was significantly associated with dyslipidaemia (<i>P</i> = 0.002) but not depression and/or anxiety (<i>P</i> = 0.29). In women, both dyslipidaemia and depression and/or anxiety were independently associated with intima-media thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.028 and <i>P</i> = 0.031). The greatest intima-media thickness was in women with both depression and/or anxiety and dyslipidaemia. These results were replicated when the general health questionnaire score was substituted for depression and/or anxiety and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol for dyslipidaemia. Depression and/or anxiety is associated with increased intima-media thickness in women but not in men. Dyslipidaemia is associated with intima-media thickness in both men and women.

31535348,Causal Pathways Between Severe Mental Illness and Behaviors Related to HIV: Patient Perspectives.,"The purpose of this study was to identify causal pathways between HIV infection and severe mental illness. Data were collected through open-ended, semi-structured interviews. An integrated approach to the analysis, using inductive and deductive coding, was used to identify patterns among respondents. Standardized instruments were used to characterize the sample in terms of risk behaviors, physical and mental functioning and depression. Twenty-six men and women with a diagnosis of HIV and unipolar depression (n = 11) or schizophrenia/schizoaffective versus bipolar disorder (n = 15) participated. For persons with unipolar depression, the HIV diagnosis often preceded depressive symptoms. For persons with schizophrenia/schizoaffective versus bipolar disorder, mania and psychosis symptoms often preceded HIV.

31794908,Convergence of psychiatric symptoms and restless legs syndrome: A cross-sectional study in an elderly French population.,"The objective was to evaluate the association between restless legs syndrome (RLS) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depression disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and GAD-depression comorbidity. Secondary aims were to examine the association between RLS with the cognitive-affective and somatic-vegetative disturbances experienced as part of depression and GAD. This was a cross-sectional study of 1493 elderly participants (median age 80.6 years, 64% women) from Dijon, France. Probable RLS was assessed using the minimal diagnostic criteria of the International Restless Legs Study Group and RLS symptom frequency and treatment. Participants underwent structured interviews for MDD, dysthymia, and GAD. Participants also completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). The association between RLS and psychiatric disorders, their criterion symptoms, or symptom factors was examined using logistic regression. The point prevalence of probable RLS in this sample was 8.2%. Probable RLS was associated with isolated GAD (odds ratio [OR] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-4.68) and comorbid GAD-any depression disorder (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.14-9.29), but not MDD or dysthymia. Probable RLS was also associated with the GAD criterion worry most days and feeling tense, and the CES-D factors representing depressed affect, somatic symptoms, and positive affect.

32885897,Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of carers of people with intellectual disabilities.,"The measures implemented to manage the COVID-19 pandemic have been shown to impair mental health. This problem is likely to be exacerbated for carers. Informal carers (mainly parents) of children and adults with intellectual disabilities, and a comparison group of parents of children without disabilities, completed an online questionnaire. Almost all the data were collected while strict lockdown conditions were in place. Relative to carers of children without intellectual disability, carers of both children and adults with intellectual disability had significantly greater levels of a wish fulfilment coping style, defeat/entrapment, anxiety, and depression. Differences were 2-3 times greater than reported in earlier pre-pandemic studies. Positive correlations were found between objective stress scores and all mental health outcomes.

32138332,Melatonin Modulates Dendrite Maturation and Complexity in the Dorsal- and Ventral- Dentate Gyrus Concomitantly with Its Antidepressant-Like Effect in Male Balb/C Mice.,"Adult neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. New neurons help to counteract the effects of stress and several interventions including antidepressant drugs, environmental modifications and internal factors act pro-neurogenic with consequences in the dorsal and ventral DG. Melatonin, the main product synthesized by the pineal gland, induces antidepressant-like effects and modulates several events of the neurogenic process. However, the information related to the capability of melatonin to modulate dendrite maturation and complexity in the dorsal and ventral regions of the DG and their correlation with its antidepressant-like effect is absent. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the impact of melatonin (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) administered daily for fourteen days on the number, dendrite complexity and distribution of doublecortin (DCX)-cells in the dorsal-ventral regions of the DG in male Balb/C mice. Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed during the course of dendritic maturation of newborn neurons. Also, we analyzed the impact of melatonin on despair-like behavior in the forced swim test. We first found a significant increase in the number and higher dendrite complexity, mainly with the doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg of melatonin (81%, 122%, 78%). These cells showed more complex dendritic trees in the ventral- and the dorsal- DG. Concomitantly, the doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg of melatonin decreased depressant-like behavior (76%, 82%). Finally, the data corroborate the antidepressant-like effect of melatonin and the increasing number of doublecortin-associated cells. Besides, the data indicate that melatonin favors the number and dendrite complexity of DCX-cells in the dorsal- and ventral- region of the DG, which may explain part of the antidepressant-like effect of melatonin.",2020-Mar-03,International journal of molecular sciences,,2020,YES,sa,How might melatonin influence neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus to exert antidepressant-like effects?,Melatonin increases the number and dendritic complexity of doublecortin-expressing cells in the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus.,"The abstract states that melatonin enhances doublecortin-associated cell numbers and dendritic complexity, particularly at doses of 2.5-10 mg/kg, which correlates with reduced despair-like behavior in the forced swim test, suggesting its antidepressant-like effects are mediated by promoting neurogenesis."

Commonly used psychotropic medications include stimulants and nonstimulants used in the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); antidepressants used in the treatment of anxiety and depression; and antipsychotics indicated for use in autism, schizophrenia, mood disorders, severe impulsivity, and aggression. Stimulants are commonly associated with appetite suppression and initial insomnia and nonstimulants for ADHD are associated with sedation. Antidepressants are generally well tolerated; adverse effects include behavioral activation early in treatment and, rarely, treatment-emergent mania and suicidal ideation.

We identified all adults (≥18 years) at their first hospital-based diagnosis of unipolar depression in Denmark between 1996 and 2015. All medical hospital contacts since 1977 and all drug prescriptions during the previous year were identified. We followed patients for up to five years regarding hospital admissions with depression and performed adjusted Cox regression analyses calculating hazard rate ratios (HRR) including 95%-confidence intervals (CI) to test the association between medical diseases and depression admission following the index depressive episode. Among 117,585 patients with depression (444,696 person-years follow-up), any prior medical hospital contact (N = 114,206; 97.1%) was associated with increased risks of admission for depression among individuals aged 18-30 (HRR=1.50; 95%CI=1.15-1.95), 31-65 (HRR=1.69; 95%CI=1.28-2.21), and >65 years (HRR=1.38; 95%CI=1.10-1.75), fitting a dose-response relationship (p<0.005) with increasing number of prior medical diseases among those aged <65.

33134190,Fecal Microbiota Changes in Patients With Postpartum Depressive Disorder.,"Postpartum depressive disorder (PPD) is a unique subtype of major depressive disorder and a substantial contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality. However, the pathogenesis of PPD has still remained elusive, and it may associate with genetic and environmental factors. Gut microbiota has already been proved to be associated with depression; however, a limited number of studies have concentrated on PPD. The present study aimed to explore the potential correlations between gut microbiota and PPD. In this study, 57 participants were enrolled, in which fecal samples of 28 patients with PPD and 16 healthy controls (HCs) were collected and then analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The results showed that diversity and composition of gut microbial communities were partly different between PPD patients and HCs. The relative abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i> phyla was lower in PPD patients. The levels of several predominant genera were significantly different between PPD patients and HCs. More importantly, the PPD patients experienced reduced levels of <i>Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Butyricicoccus</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, as well as increased levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> family. In addition, a correlation was observed between levels of <i>Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Tyzzerella.3</i> and the severity of depressive symptoms. Various kinds of bacteria, such as <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, were found to be associated with levels of sex hormones.

32818219,"The burden of anxiety among people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pune, India.","Globally, India has the third largest population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited. During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score ≥10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score≥10 vs GAD-7 score<10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis. Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income <200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38% and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n=41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score ≥10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p=0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability.

I relate my experiences to a growing body of research, which have important implications for improving care. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH NURSING?: Healthcare professionals should make patients aware of potential withdrawal symptoms they may experience before they wean off antidepressants; regularly review their progress; consider helping them access psychological support whilst weaning off; and engage in open and collaborative conversations with patients throughout. Clinical guidance needs to be updated to provide appropriate evidence-based information/advice/recommendations for how best to support patients when coming off of antidepressants. ABSTRACT: A significant proportion of the UK population are taking antidepressants, and have been taking them for at least a year. Clinical guidelines have controversially stated that withdrawal symptoms when weaning off antidepressants are mild and resolve after one week, with the proviso that they can be severe only if the drug is stopped abruptly. However, recent evidence suggests this is not the case. I describe my own experiences of tapering the dose of my antidepressants after several years of taking them. I describe my encounters with healthcare professionals throughout this period, detailing conflicting advice I have received, along with describing the mental and physical withdrawal symptoms I have experienced. My experiences relate to a growing body of research, which have important implications for improving care. Potential learning outcomes are that healthcare professionals should make patients aware of potential withdrawal symptoms they may experience before they wean off antidepressants; regularly review their progress; consider helping them access psychological support whilst weaning off; and engage in open and collaborative conversations with patients throughout the process.

Tobacco consumption, obesity, educational level, age, sex, welfare quintile, area of residence, having health insurance, and natural region of residence were included as covariates in the analysis. The frequency of OHSU in older adults was 18.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8 to 19.3). The highest percentage point (%p) differences with regards to OHSU were found between the extreme categories of educational level (higher education vs. none or elementary school: +24.8%p) and welfare quintile (richest vs. poorest: +24.0%p). In the crude model, OHSU was associated with diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.69), but this association disappeared after adjustment for covariates. Meanwhile, depression decreased the likelihood of OHSU (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.95) in the adjusted model. The frequency of OHSU was low in older Peruvian adults. Regarding CCs, we found that depression independently decreased the likelihood of OHSU in the adjusted model.

The symptoms of UI in women are known to have a variety of effects on their health. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the effects of changes in UI status on depressive symptoms and identify determinants of the progression of UI among South Korean women 45 years old and above. Data were collected from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging from 2012 to 2016. Participants were categorized into five groups by the results of a prior panel survey on UI status: ""Recovered,"" ""Better,"" ""Same,"" ""Worse,"" and ""No symptoms of urinary incontinence."" We used the generalized estimating equation model and performed subgroup analyses based on age, working status, household income, perceived health status, and the number of chronic medical conditions. A total of 3,957 middle-aged and older women were included in the analysis. Those with a change to ""worse"" UI status (β: 0.408, P=0.005) had higher depressive symptom scores than those who reported ""no symptoms of UI."" Conversely, those with a ""better"" (β: -0.271, P=0.0131) or ""recovered"" (β: -0.518, P=0.0020) UI status had lower depressive symptom scores than those with ""no symptom of UI"". Younger women and those with a ""better"" or ""recovered"" status showed a tendency of having fewer depressive symptoms. Older women and those with a ""worse"" status showed a tendency of having more depressive symptoms. The cause of UI could not be evaluated.

The review was conducted as per PRISMA-2009 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Initially, 6316 articles were searched from three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). Finally, 20 articles were filtered to be included in our review. Among different types of psychological impact, stress was reported that lies within the range from 5.2% to 100%, anxiety was reported from 11.1% to 100%, depression was from 10.6% to 58%, and insomnia was from 28.75% to 34%. Several factors were related to the negative psychological state of health care workers due to coronavirus disease-19 like educational level, occupation, gender, age, working environment, work experience, legal status, ethnicity, psychological comorbidity, social support, personal/family exposure, and feeling of health care providers. The most common psychological impacts among health care workers were anxiety and stress. Besides different sociodemographic factors that determine the psychological impacts, front-line health care workers and participants having psychological comorbidity have a high risk of negative psychological state impacts as compared to their counterparts.

33938670,[Psychometric properties of the Hungarian Adult Attachment Scale].,"The revised Adult Attachment Scale (AAS) developed by N. L. Collins is a widely used questionnaire to measure adult attachment. However, its psychometric properties have not been investigated in Hungary. We aimed to confirm the key psychometric properties of the Hungarian version of the AAS focusing on reliability indices on a population that consis-ted of depressed and non-depressed young adults. The AAS is a self-report questionnaire, in which two different dimensional evaluating systems are possible: the original (close, depend, and anxiety) and the alternative scoring system (anxiety, avoidance). Our study population consisted of young adults with a history of major depression (n = 264, median age = 25.7 years) and their never-depressed biological siblings (n = 244, median age = 24.0). The internal consistency of close, anxiety, and avoidance scales were satisfactory (Cronbach-α >0.7). The consistency of the depend scale was slightly lower than expected (Cronbach-α = 0.62). Test-retest reliability was good for all of the scales, it ranged from 0.73 to 0.78 after 14 months of follow-up period. The scale showed good discrimination as tested by the differences of close and anxiety attachment dimensions between the groups (p<0.01).

32056058,Effect of Daily Teacher Feedback on Subsequent Motivation and Mental Health Outcomes in Fifth Grade Students: a Person-Centered Analysis.,"Prevention scientists recognize that implementing effective prevention practices and programs responsive to the needs of individuals but based solely upon the findings from variable-centered methods presents several limitations due to numerous risk factors, pathways, and unobserved influences. One such understudied influence that is masked by variable-centered methods, motivation, is a person-level characteristic that influences treatment outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of an alternative person-centered approach, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), to model change over time that focuses on the interdependence of daily student motivation levels and teacher feedback and their relations to student outcomes over time. Specifically, we used GIMME to model person level responses to negative teacher feedback regarding students' next day motivational ratings using data from 58 5th grade students participating in a study of the impact of the self-monitoring and regulation training strategy (SMARTS). Results identified a set of SMARTS students whose daily readiness aligned with high rates of self and teacher agreement regarding ongoing performance ratings. However, results identified a group of students whose daily motivation and readiness for change was adversely impacted by negative teacher feedback the day before. For these students, they were more likely than their peers to experience high levels of depression and internalization scores.

34775120,Levels of depressed mood and low interest for two years after response to cognitive therapy for recurrent depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves depressed mood (high negative affect, predominantly) and low interest/pleasure (low positive affect). In past research, negative affect has improved more than positive affect during acute-phase antidepressant medication or cognitive therapy (CT). We extended this literature by differentiating depressed mood and two dimensions of low interest (general and sexual), assessing persistence of symptom differences after acute-phase CT response, and testing whether continuation treatment acted differently on depressed mood versus low interest. We analyzed data from two randomized controlled trials. Patients with recurrent MDD first received acute-phase CT. Then, responders were randomized to 8-month continuation treatments and assessed for 16-24 additional months. Depressed mood and low general interest improved more than low sexual interest during acute-phase CT. Among responders, these symptom differences persisted for at least 2 years and were not changed by continuation CT or antidepressant medication. Generalization of findings to other patient populations and treatments is uncertain. Depressed mood and low interest scales were constructed from standard symptom measures and overlapped empirically.

Using a nationally representative sample of PLWH, this study examines the prevalence, time-trends, and correlates of current cigarette smoking among PLWH compared to people without HIV. Secondary analysis of population-based cross-sectional biobehavioral survey. Data were pooled from the 1999-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All adults (20-59 years) who self-reported their smoking status and were tested for HIV (HIV+ = 152; HIV- = 26 305) were included in the analysis. Prevalence with 95% confidence interval (95% CI), trend analysis by year and group (HIV+/HIV-), and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed with the complex survey design adjustments. Overall, 47.0% of PLWH were current smokers compared to 25.5% of those without HIV. From 1999 to 2016, the decline in smoking in PLWH was comparable to those without HIV (10.7% vs. 8.0%). PLWH smokers were more likely than PLWH nonsmokers to be substance users (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 17.52; 95% CI = 2.04 to 27.8).

33784356,Statins for major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The burden of depressive disorder is large and new treatment approaches are required. Repurposing widely available drugs such as statins may be a time- and cost-effective solution. Statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties which have been shown to be relevant to the pathophysiology of depression. This study assesses the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and safety of statins in major depressive disorder. Our study is an update and extension of a previous meta-analysis published in 2016 by Salagre et al. We performed a systematic review (PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov until the 1st September 2020) and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using any statin against placebo or any other statin in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Our primary efficacy outcome measure was the mean value on any standardized scale for depressive symptoms at 8 weeks of treatment. We also calculated outcomes for efficacy, response, and remission at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, as well as acceptability (dropouts for any cause), tolerability (dropouts due to any adverse event), and safety (any adverse event) outcomes at the studies' endpoints. Furthermore, we conducted an exploratory network meta-analysis for the primary efficacy outcome to identify potential differences between statins. We retrieved five randomized controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria: four used a statin in addition to an antidepressant and compared it to placebo plus antidepressant, and one compared two statins alone. and one comparing one statin with another. Statins compared to placebo in addition to antidepressants were efficacious at 8 weeks (N = 255, SMD = -0.48, 95% CI = -0.74 to -0. 22) and 12 weeks (N = 134, SMD = -0.47, 95% CI = -0.89 to -0.05, moderate certainty) with no difference for acceptability, tolerability, and safety (low certainty). An exploratory network meta-analysis suggested that the most lipophilic statins, especially simvastatin, could be more efficacious than less lipophilic or hydrophilic molecules.

34842002,"Cognitive reappraisal, emotional suppression, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in later life: The moderating role of gender.","Although socioemotional selectivity (SST) suggests that people experience more positive affect as they age, symptoms of anxiety and depression persist and are often greater in older women than men. Coping strategies may influence the extent to which older adults experience these symptoms. The purpose of the current study is to examine possible gender differences in the use of an adaptive (cognitive reappraisal (CR) and a maladaptive (emotive suppression (ES) emotion regulation strategy in relation to depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our study uses cross-sectional data drawn from a community sample of older adults (60+; <i>n</i> = 906). We used OLS regression and moderation analyses to test our study hypotheses. Gender moderated the association between CR in both depressive and anxiety symptoms. Women reported greater use of CR relative to men. Further, CR use was negatively related to symptoms of anxiety and depression in women, but not men. In contrast, men used ES more frequently than women, though older men and women's use of ES was unrelated to anxiety or depressive symptoms. Our findings provide initial evidence that greater CR use in older women is related to lower symptoms of both anxiety and depression relative to older men. Age-related increases in CR use (e.g. SST) among women may serve to decrease anxiety and depression symptoms. Findings suggest decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms via CR may benefit older women more than older men.

34109854,Depression Following Operative Treatments for Achilles Ruptures and Ankle Fractures.,"The sudden and debilitating nature of lower extremity injuries can trigger mood disturbances, including major depressive disorder. This prospective study enrolled patients undergoing operative repair of ankle fractures and Achilles ruptures and followed them for 1 year postoperatively. The validated Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms was administered at the preoperative visit and at postoperative weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 52. PHQ-9 is scored 0 to 27, with higher values indicating greater depression symptoms. Fifty-eight patients completed 1 year of follow-up. The mean PHQ-9 score was 2.7 (range, 0-20) at the preoperative visit, peaked at postoperative week 1 (4.9; range, 0-16), and reached its low at postoperative week 52 (0.8; range, 0-7). Cumulative incidences of depressive symptoms during the first year following surgery were 51.7% for at least mild depression, 22.4% for at least moderate depression, and 6.9% for severe depression. A history of mental health disorder and the inability to work during the period of postoperative immobilization were independently associated with greater depressive symptoms. The majority of patients undergoing operative treatment of Achilles ruptures and ankle fractures develop postoperative symptoms of mild to moderate depression that normalize after several months.

33845017,Incremental Economic Burden of Depression in Ophthalmic Patients.,"We sought to analyze the incremental economic burden of depression on adults with concurrent ophthalmic conditions in the United States. Retrospective cross-sectional study. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2016 to 2018, ophthalmic patients with ≥1 outpatient visit were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification codes and stratified based on the presence of concurrent depression. A multivariate 2-part regression model was used to determine incremental economic burden, health care sector utilization, and expenditures. Of 7279 ophthalmic patients, 1123 (15.43%) were diagnosed with depression (mean expenditures $17,017.25 ± $2019.13) and 6156 patients (84.57%) without depression (mean expenditures $9924.50 ± $692.94). Patients with depression were more likely to be female, white, lower income, use Medicare/Medicaid, and to have comorbidities (P < .001). These patients faced $5894.86 (95% confidence interval $4222.33-$7348.36, P < .001) in incremental economic expenditures because of depression, resulting in an additional $22.4 billion annually when extrapolating nationally. These patients had higher utilization for all health care service sectors (P < .025 for all) and higher expenditures for outpatient (P = .022) and prescription medications (P = .029) when adjusted for sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Depression was responsible for 6.9% of inpatient admissions (the second-leading cause) for this cohort of patients. Ophthalmic patients with depression had a higher incremental economic burden and health care service sector utilization and expenditures. Patients with ophthalmic pathologies, including dry eye syndrome, blindness, and retinopathies, were more likely to be depressed.

35211201,"A review of the prevalence, associated factors and interventions of psychological symptoms among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic.","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed tremendous pressure on public health systems across the world. Compared with the healthy population, cancer patients are more prone to developing psychological problems, including depression and anxiety, because of worries about cancer recurrence, cancer symptoms, treatment-related discomfort, a lack of social interaction and the impact on their financial well-being. This paper aimed to identify existing evidence on psychological symptoms and their associated factors among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on interventions to effectively manage these symptoms. Articles related to the prevalence, the risk factors and interventions of psychological symptoms among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during COVID-19 published between December 2019 and August 2020 were searched in two English (PubMed and Embase) and two Chinese (CNKI and Wan Fang Data) databases. A total of 180 studies were identified, and 18 studies were included in the review after removing duplicates and screening for relevancy. The results suggest that patients with cancer in the Chinese Mainland have suffered psychological pressure during COVID-19, with a high prevalence of psychological distress, depression and anxiety reported across most of the reviewed studies. Pandemic-related factors such as treatment discontinuation and worry about being infected are associated with these symptoms. Nurses may help to relieve these symptoms by identifying stressors, providing relevant information through mass and social media and referring patients to specialists for psychological support.

34006462,"The effect of virtual reality on Children's anxiety, fear, and pain levels before circumcision.","Circumcision is one of the oldest and most frequently performed surgical interventions in many societies across the world. Boys undergoing this procedure experience anxiety and fear during the preoperative period. In addition, postoperative pain in children is reported to be associated with anxiety and fear. This study aimed to examine the effects of using virtual reality (VR) intervention before circumcision on the pre-and postoperative anxiety and fear levels and postoperative pain symptoms in children. This randomized controlled experimental study included 5-10-year-old boys referred to a pediatric hospital for circumcision between June and September 2019. Randomization was performed using the randomized block design, and the subjects were divided into control (n = 38) and experimental (n = 40) groups. The data were collected using a participant information form, the children's fear scale (CFS), the children's anxiety meter scale (CAM-S), and the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBS); data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 package program. Of the children included in the study, 59% were between the ages of five and six years and 78.2% had no previous hospital experience. Children in the experimental group had significantly lower mean scores of CAM-S and CFS in the pre-and postoperative periods than those in the control group. Also, the mean postoperative WBS score was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Results of this study were similar to those reported previously that VR interventions were effective in reducing fear and anxiety in the preoperative period (Dehghan et al., 2019, Ryu et al., 2018; Olbrechta et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that patient immersion in interactive VR provides a distraction from painful stimuli and can decrease an individual's perception of the pain (Pouarmand et al., 2018; Chad et al., 2018).

33689981,Discrepancies between self-rated depression and observed depression severity: The effects of personality and dysfunctional attitudes.,"Patient self-reports and clinician ratings of depression severity can differ substantially. The aim of the current study was to explore factors associated with discrepancies between depressed patients' Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) self-reports and clinicians' Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) ratings. We first computed discrepancy scores defined as the standardized weighted HAMD-17 total score minus the standardized PHQ-9 total score. To assess correlates of inconsistent scores, results of patients with similar standardized scores were removed (i.e., within ½ standard deviation, n = 270). Positive values indicate underreporting (HAMD-17 > PHQ-9), i.e., the underreporting group (n = 200); and negative discrepancy scores indicate overreporting (PHQ-9 > HAMD-17), i.e., the overreporting group (n = 221). We examined the relationship of demographic, dysfunctional attitudes and personality variables to the discrepancies between self and observer rated depression. There were significant differences in extraversion, psychoticism, neuroticism, dysfunctional attitudes and occupation between the underreporting group and the overreporting group (all p < .05). When controlling for potential confounding variables, being a working professional and having high neuroticism and dysfunctional attitudes were significantly associated with overestimating symptoms of depression (e.g., professional: OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.67-5.00; p < .001; high neuroticism: OR, 7.08; 95% CI, 1.47-34.08; p < .001;dysfunctional attitudes: OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; p = .030).

33778840,Data-Driven Model Building for Life-Course Epidemiology.,"Life-course epidemiology is useful for describing and analyzing complex etiological mechanisms for disease development, but existing statistical methods are essentially confirmatory, because they rely on a priori model specification. This limits the scope of causal inquiries that can be made, because these methods are suited mostly to examine well-known hypotheses that do not question our established view of health, which could lead to confirmation bias. We propose an exploratory alternative. Instead of specifying a life-course model prior to data analysis, our method infers the life-course model directly from the data. Our proposed method extends the well-known Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm (named after its authors) for causal discovery, and it facilitates including temporal information for inferring a model from observational data. The extended algorithm is called temporal PC. The obtained life-course model can afterward be perused for interesting causal hypotheses. Our method complements classical confirmatory methods and guides researchers in expanding their models in new directions. We showcase the method using a data set encompassing almost 3,000 Danish men followed from birth until age 65 years.

34325234,Predictive protein markers for depression severity in mood disorders: A preliminary trans-diagnostic approach study.,"Depression is a common symptom of many mental disorders, especially major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Previous studies have reported that these diseases share common pathophysiological pathways; therefore, this study elucidated whether the plasma levels of protein markers related to common depressive symptoms differed between patients with BD and those with MDD. Plasma samples of 71 patients with mood disorders and clinical manifestations were analyzed in this study. After depleting the abundant proteins, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and label-free quantification were performed. Five proteins, viz., cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), apolipoprotein D (APOD), mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP2), Ig lambda chain V-II region BO (IGLV2-8) and Ig kappa chain V-III region NG9 (IGKV3-20) were negatively associated with the total scores of the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D), after adjusting for the covariates. CETP and APOD also showed significant negative correlations with the anhedonia/retardation and guilt/agitation scores of the HAM-D. Four proteins, namely, Ig kappa chain V-II region TEW (IGKC; IGKV2D-28), Ig lambda variable 5-45 (IGLV5-45), complement factor H (CFH) and attractin (ATRN), showed significant associations with anhedonia/retardation after adjusting for covariates.

34363507,"Age affects temporal response, but not durability, to serial ketamine infusions for treatment refractory depression.","Ketamine is a novel, rapid-acting antidepressant for treatment refractory depression (TRD); however, clinical durability is poor and treatment response trajectories vary. Little is known about which patient characteristics predict faster or more durable ketamine responses. Ketamine's antidepressant mechanism may involve modulation of glutamatergic signaling and long-term potentiation (LTP); these neuroplasticity pathways are also attenuated with older age. A retrospective analysis examining the impact of patient age on the speed and durability of ketamine's antidepressant effects in 49 veterans receiving serial intravenous ketamine infusions for TRD. The relationship between age and percent change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores was compared across six serial ketamine infusions (twice-weekly for 3 weeks) using a linear-mixed model. A significant Age-X-Infusion number interaction (F = 3.01, p = .0274) indicated that the relationship between age and treatment response depended on infusion number. Follow-up tests showed that younger age significantly predicted greater clinical improvement at infusion #4 (t = 3.02, p = .004); this relationship was attenuated at infusion #5 (t = 1.95, p = .057) and was absent at infusion #6. Age was not a significant predictor of treatment durability, defined as percent change in BDI-II 3 weeks following infusion #6. These data preliminarily suggest that younger age is associated with a faster response over six serial ketamine infusions; by infusion #6 and subsequent weeks of clinical follow-up, age no longer predicts ketamine's antidepressant activity.

34283658,Anxiety and Depression Among Transgender People: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Online Survey in Russia.,"<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> As we still do not know enough about the mental health concerns of gender minority people in Russia, there is a need to initiate research on these issues. We aimed to examine the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms in a Russian sample of transgender people. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The study consisted of a structured online survey and was conducted throughout November 2019. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used for online screening of anxiety and depression symptoms. A total of 588 transgender adults living in all Federal Districts of Russia (mean age 24.0 ± standard deviation 6.7) was included in the final analysis. <b><i>Results:</i></b> It was found that 45.1% (<i>n</i> = 265) and 24.0% (<i>n</i> = 141) of transgender people had clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. No statistically significant differences in the prevalence of anxiety and depression were found among those who identified as a transgender man, a transgender woman, or other transgender identities. The anxiety and depression mean scores in the sample were statistically significantly higher than in the general Russian population (<i>p</i> < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in the level of depression and anxiety symptoms among respondents in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other Russian cities. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> We found high rates of clinical symptoms of depression and anxiety among transgender people, consistent with international research. The study highlights the need for further research on the psychological well-being and mental health of transgender people, and the availability of psychiatric care to transgender people living in Russia.",2021,LGBT health,Journal Article,2021,YES,sa,What statistical finding supports the need for targeted mental health interventions for transgender individuals in Russia?,Transgender individuals in Russia had significantly higher mean scores for anxiety and depression compared to the general Russian population (p < 0.001).,"The abstract reports statistically significant higher levels of anxiety and depression in transgender individuals compared to the general population, emphasizing the need for tailored mental health support."
34842659,"COVID-19 Lockdown-Related Changes in Mood, Health and Academic Functioning.","The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns were accompanied by an abrupt transition from face-to-face education to online education. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic functioning and mood in Dutch pharmacy students and PhD candidates. A total of <i>n</i> = 341 participants completed an online survey including questions on mood and academic functioning, assessed retrospectively for before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, during COVID-19 lockdown, significantly more time was spent on academic activities, and study grades/output significantly improved. However, the overall effects were of small magnitude, and there was great variability among students, reporting either improved, unchanged or poorer academic functioning. Compared to before COVID-19, the lockdown periods were associated with significantly increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and loneliness, and a significant reduction in optimism and happiness. Significant negative correlations were found between 'performance quality' and stress, 'performance quality' and fatigue, 'study grades/output' and stress, and between 'study grades/output' and fatigue. Correlations of mood and items related to academic interactions were not statistically significant. Differential effects were seen when the data was analyzed according to sex, living situation, and ethnicity, revealing that women, students living alone, and those with a migration background reported that COVID-19 lockdowns had greater negative mood effects and a more negative impact on academic functioning. Poorer sleep quality and reduced quality of life were significantly associated with reduced mood, as well as reduced academic performance quality and role satisfaction. Regression analysis revealed that being young and not having a non-Western migration background were predictors of improved performance quality. However, only being young was a significant predictor of improved study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased levels of stress and fatigue were significant predictors of both reduced performance quality and poorer study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, for the sample as a whole, the transition to online education during the COVID-19 lockdown was judged as having significant positive effects on academic performance. The lockdown periods were associated with significantly reduced mood and reduced social interactions. It should be taken into account that about one third of students reported academic functioning to be poorer during the COVID-19 pandemic. This represents a substantial group of students who require more attention and guidance to make a successful transition to online education and cope with lockdown-associated stress and fatigue.",2021-Nov-18,"European journal of investigation in health, psychology and education",Journal Article,2021,YES,sa,Which demographic factors might predispose students to greater vulnerability to clinical anxiety or depression during a societal lockdown?,"Female sex, living alone, and migration background.","The abstract identifies women, students living alone, and those with a migration background as reporting greater negative mood effects during COVID-19 lockdowns, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression."
33568318,Neurobiology of the Rapid-Acting Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine: Impact and Opportunities.,"The discovery of the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine has 1) led to a paradigm shift in our perception of what is possible in treating severe depression; 2) spurred a wave of basic, translation, and clinical research; and 3) provided an unprecedented investigational tool to conduct longitudinal mechanistic studies that may capture behavioral changes as complex as clinical remission and relapse within hours and days of treatment. Unfortunately, these advances did not yet translate into clinical biomarkers or novel treatments, beyond ketamine. In contrast to slow-acting antidepressants, in which targeting monoaminergic receptors identified several efficacious drugs with comparable mechanisms, the focus on the receptor targets of ketamine has failed in several clinical trials over the past decade. Thus, it is becoming increasingly crucial that we concentrate our effort on the downstream molecular mechanisms of ketamine and their effects on the brain circuitry and networks. Honoring the legacy of our mentor, friend, and colleague Ron Duman, we provide a historical note on the discovery of ketamine and its putative mechanisms. We then detail the molecular and circuits effect of ketamine based on preclinical findings, followed by a summary of the impact of this work on our understanding of chronic stress pathology across psychiatric disorders, with particular emphasis on the role of synaptic connectivity and its brain network effects in the pathology and treatment of clinical depression.",2021-Jul-15,Biological psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",2021,YES,sa,Why has the focus on the receptor targets of ketamine not yet led to the development of novel antidepressant treatments beyond ketamine itself?,"Targeting ketamine's receptor mechanisms has failed in clinical trials, highlighting the need to explore downstream molecular mechanisms and their effects on brain circuitry.","The abstract notes that clinical trials targeting ketamine's receptor mechanisms have been unsuccessful, emphasizing the importance of studying downstream molecular effects and synaptic connectivity to advance treatment development for clinical depression."
34849356,Effects of Reflexology on the Pain Intensity among Patients with Depression after Receiving Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"<b>Introduction:</b> High prevalence of psychiatric disorders and the high effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have made this treatment a useful intervention. Memory impairment, headache, and muscle pain are the most important complications after ECT. This research aimed to determine the effect of reflexology on the headache and muscle pain intensity of patients after receiving ECT. <b>Methods:</b> This randomized controlled trial was conducted in Razi teaching hospital of Urmia, Iran. A total of 56 patients with depression receiving ECT were randomly assigned into two equal groups of control (n=28) and intervention (n=28). In the intervention group, reflexology was performed for 20 minutes at reflex points and, in the control group, only the conventional measures were taken. Pain intensity was measured with visual analogue scale (VAS) before and 1, 6, and 24 hours after the intervention. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 13. Furthermore, chi-square, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, and repeated-measures tests were performed. <b>Results:</b> The mean difference in the severity of headache and muscle pain in the intervention group was significantly reduced compared to the control group. Moreover, the results demonstrated a significant difference between the mean headache and muscle pain in the two groups after the intervention. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this study showed the positive effect of reflexology on reducing the intensity of pain in patients receiving ECT.

34143240,Paradoxical changes in mood-related behaviors on continuous social isolation after weaning.,"Continuous social isolation (SI) from an early developmental stage may have different effects in youth and adulthood. Moreover, SI is reported to impair neuronal plasticity. In this study, we used post-weaning rats to compare the impact of continuous SI on depressive-like, anxiety-related, and fear-related behaviors and neuronal plasticity in puberty and adulthood. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of lithium on behavioral changes and neuronal plasticity. Continuous SI after weaning induced depressive-like behaviors in puberty; however, in adulthood, depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors did not increase, but-paradoxically-decreased in comparison with the controls. The decreased expression of neuronal plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus in puberty was more prominent in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in adulthood. In contrast, SI after weaning tended to decrease fear-related behaviors in puberty, a decrease which was more prominent in adulthood with increased neuronal plasticity-related protein expression in the amygdala. Lithium administration over the last 14 days of the SI-induced period removed the behavioral and expression changes of neuronal plasticity-related proteins observed in puberty and adulthood. Our findings suggest that the extension of the duration of SI from an early developmental stage does not simply worsen depressive-like behaviors; rather, it induces a behavior linked to neuronal plasticity damage. Lithium may improve behavioral changes in puberty and adulthood by reversing damage to neuronal plasticity. The mechanisms underlying the depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors may differ from those underlying fear-related behaviors.",2021-Aug,Experimental brain research,Journal Article,2021,YES,sa,How might continuous social isolation from an early developmental stage paradoxically affect depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors in adulthood compared to puberty?,Depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors paradoxically decrease in adulthood compared to puberty.,The abstract states that continuous social isolation after weaning induces depressive-like behaviors in puberty but paradoxically decreases depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors in adulthood.

It is associated with depression and tendencies of eating disorders. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the two and the mediating role of self-control for adolescents. In total, 1,231 adolescents (11-18 years) participated in this study. Self-control, depression, and tendencies of eating disorders were evaluated using the Dual-Mode of Self-Control Scale (DMSC-S), 11-item Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale (KADS-11), and Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26). The correlations among these factors were analyzed using mediating effect models. Girls had higher scores on the both subscales (impulse system and control system) of DMSC-S (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Those between 15-18 years had higher scores on impulse system than those between 11-14 years (<i>P</i> < 0.001).

34471414,Exploring the Mechanism of Action of Herbal Medicine (<i>Gan-Mai-Da-Zao</i> Decoction) for Poststroke Depression Based on Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking.,"Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most common and serious neuropsychiatric complication occurring after cerebrovascular accidents, seriously endangering human health while also imposing a heavy burden on society. Nevertheless, it is difficult to control disease progression. <i>Gan-Mai-Da-Zao</i> Decoction (GMDZD) is effective for PSD, but its mechanism of action in PSD is unknown. In this study, we explored the mechanism of action of GMDZD in PSD treatment using network pharmacology and molecular docking. <i>Material and methods</i>. We obtained the active components of all drugs and their targets from the public database TCMSP and published articles. Then, we collected PSD-related targets from the GeneCards and OMIM databases. Cytoscape 3.8.2 was applied to construct PPI and composite target disease networks. In parallel, the DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG enrichment analyses to determine the biological processes enriched in the treatment-related drugs in vivo. Finally, molecular docking was used to verify the association between the main active ingredients and their targets. The network pharmacological analysis of GMDZD in PSD revealed 107 active ingredients with important biological effects, including quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, naringenin, and isorhamnetin. In total, 203 potential targets for the treatment of this disease were screened, including STAT3, JUN, TNF, TPT53, AKT1, and EGFR. These drugs are widely enriched in a series of signaling pathways, such as TNF, HIF-1, and toll-like receptor. Moreover, molecular docking analysis showed that the core active components were tightly bound to their core targets, further confirming their anti-PSD effects. This prospective study was based on the integrated analysis of large data using network pharmacology technology to explore the feasibility of GMDZD for PSD treatment that was successfully validated by molecular docking. It reflects the multicomponent and multitarget characteristics of Chinese medicine and, more importantly, brings hope for the clinical treatment of PSD.",2021,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,Journal Article,2021,YES,sa,Which signaling pathways are implicated in the mechanism of action of Gan-Mai-Da-Zao Decoction (GMDZD) for the treatment of poststroke depression (PSD)?,"TNF, HIF-1, and toll-like receptor pathways.","The abstract identifies these pathways as being widely enriched in the treatment-related mechanisms of GMDZD for PSD, highlighting their role in the drug's multicomponent and multitarget therapeutic effects."
33938260,Patterns and predictors of trajectories for subjective quality of life in patients with early psychosis: Three-year follow-up of the randomized controlled trial on extended early intervention.,"Subjective quality of life is an important outcome of psychotic disorders. However, longitudinal course of subjective quality of life in the early illness stage is under-studied. We aimed to investigate the patterns and baseline predictors of subjective quality of life trajectories over 3 years in early psychosis patients, utilizing growth mixing modeling analysis, in the context of a 3-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial comparing 1-year extension of early intervention with step-down psychiatric care for first-episode psychosis. One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from specialized early intervention program for first-episode psychosis in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year early intervention service, and underwent 1-year randomized controlled trial as well as 2-year post-randomized controlled trial follow-up (i.e. 3-year follow-up). Assessments on premorbid adjustment, onset profile, psychopathology, functioning and treatment characteristics were conducted. Individual class membership of subjective quality of life trajectory derived from growth mixing modeling was based on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary scores measured at four different time-points (baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years) among 142 participants across 3-year follow-up. Three distinct subjective quality of life trajectories were identified including higher-improving (68.3%, <i>n</i> = 97), lower-stable (24.6%, <i>n</i> = 35) and deteriorating (7%, <i>n</i> = 10) trajectories. Age of onset; duration of untreated psychosis; depressive, positive and negative symptoms; and intervention condition were significantly different between good (higher-improving trajectory) and poor (combined lower-stable and deteriorating trajectories) trajectory groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age of onset, more severe depression and receipt of step-down care independently predicted poor subjective quality of life trajectory. Approximately one-third of patients displayed poor subjective quality of life trajectory in the early phase of psychotic illness. Our results affirm depression as a critical determinant of prospective subjective quality of life and underscores positive effect of extended early intervention on sustained subjective quality of life improvement. Further longitudinal research is warranted to facilitate better characterization of subjective quality of life course patterns and development of targeted intervention to optimize subjective quality of life in patients with early psychosis.",2021-Oct,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,2021,YES,sa,What clinical factors independently predict a poor subjective quality of life trajectory in early psychosis patients?,"Younger age of onset, more severe depression, and receipt of step-down care.","The abstract identifies younger age of onset, severity of depression, and step-down care as independent predictors of poor subjective quality of life trajectory in early psychosis patients."
33146667,Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence. Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment-resistant depression. To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD. This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay. The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR). Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9). The mean (SD) GRID-HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 (8.0 [7.1] and 8.5 [5.7]) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 (23.8 [5.4] and 23.5 [6.0]) in the delayed treatment group. The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.0; P < .001). In the overall sample, 17 participants (71%) at week 1 and 17 (71%) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention (≥50% reduction in GRID-HAMD score), and 14 participants (58%) at week 1 and 13 participants (54%) at week 4 were in remission (≤7 GRID-HAMD score). Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD, thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

34060280,Physical and psychological sequelae at three months after acute illness in COVID-19 survivors.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may leave behind an altered health status early after recovery. We evaluated the clinical status of COVID-19 survivors at three months after hospital discharge. In this prospective observational cohort study, hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years, evaluated at one (M1) and three (M3) months post-discharge were enrolled. 251 patients (71.3% males, median [IQR] age 61.8 [53.5-70.7] years) were included. Median (IQR) time from discharge to M3 was 89 (79.5-101) days. Primary outcome was residual respiratory dysfunction (RRD), defined by tachypnea, moderate to very severe dyspnea, or peripheral oxygen saturation ≤95% on room air at M3. RRD was found in 30.4% of patients, with no significant difference compared with M1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and length of stay were independent predictors of RRD at multivariable logistic regression (OR [95% CI]: 4.13 [1.17-16.88], P=0.033; OR [95% CI]: 1.02 [1.00-1.04], P=0.047, respectively). Obesity and C-reactive protein levels upon admission were additional predictors at regression tree analysis. Impaired quality of life (QoL) was reported by 53.2% of patients. Anxiety and insomnia were each present in 25.5% of patients, and PTSD in 22.4%. No difference was found between M1 and M3 in QoL, anxiety or PTSD. Insomnia decreased at M3.

19893498,Insomnia and sleep duration as mediators of the relationship between depression and hypertension incidence.,"Depression has been found to predict the incidence of hypertension and other adverse cardiovascular events in prospective studies. Insomnia and short sleep duration, which are typical symptoms of depression, have also been shown to increase the risk for hypertension incidence. Insomnia is associated with increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and short sleep duration raises average 24-h blood pressure, which over time could lead to structural adaptations that gradually reset the entire cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium. No previous published population studies have examined whether insomnia and sleep duration mediate the relationship between depression and hypertension incidence. We conducted multivariate longitudinal (1982-1992) analyses stratified by age of the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) (n = 4,913) using Cox proportional hazards models. Middle-aged subjects who suffered from depression at baseline were 44% more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension over the follow-up period after controlling for covariates (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.80). Both short sleep duration and insomnia were also significantly associated with hypertension incidence. Consistent with insomnia and sleep duration acting as mediators of the relationship between depression and hypertension incidence, the inclusion of these variables in the multivariate models appreciably attenuated the association (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.00-1.61). Depression, sleep duration, and insomnia were not significantly associated with hypertension incidence in elderly subjects. These results suggest the hypothesis that treatment of sleep problems in middle-aged individuals suffering from depression could reduce their risk for developing hypertension, and its vascular and cardiac complications.",2010-Jan,American journal of hypertension,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2009,YES,sa,How might insomnia and short sleep duration mediate the relationship between clinical depression and hypertension development in middle-aged patients?,"Insomnia activates the HPA axis, while short sleep duration raises 24-hour blood pressure, causing structural cardiovascular changes that elevate pressure equilibrium.","The abstract states insomnia and short sleep duration contribute to hypertension by HPA axis activation and blood pressure elevation, attenuating depression's direct impact on hypertension in middle-aged patients."
19268727,Relation of inflammation to depression and incident coronary heart disease (from the Canadian Nova Scotia Health Survey [NSHS95] Prospective Population Study).,"Numerous studies have found that depression was a strong independent risk factor for incident coronary heart disease (CHD), with increasing risk in those with higher levels of depressive symptoms. The association between measures of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1), depressive symptoms, and CHD incidence was examined in 1,794 subjects of the population-based Canadian Nova Scotia Health Survey. There were 152 incident CHD events (8.5%; 141 nonfatal, 11 fatal) during the 15,514 person-years of observation (incidence rate 9.8 events/1,000 person-years). Depression and inflammation were correlated at baseline and each significantly predicted CHD in separate models. When both risk factors were in the same model, each remained significant. The association between depressed group by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (score > or =10 vs 0 to 9) and CHD incidence (hazard rate 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 2.27) was not reduced by the addition of inflammatory markers to the model (hazard rate 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 2.26). Findings were similar after adjustment for aspirin, lipid-lowering medication, or antidepressant use, and the association did not vary by gender, smoking status, age, obesity, cardiovascular medication use, or antidepressant use.

19452107,Prevalence of depression diagnosis and prescription of antidepressants in East and West Germany: an analysis of health insurance data.,"This study aimed to analyse depression-related factors. The prevalence of depression has been shown in prior surveys to vary between East and West Germany. Do these differences also appear in health insurance data? The outpatient data of a large German statutory health insurance company were analysed for regional differences in (a) the prevalence of depression diagnosis, (b) prescription rates of antidepressants and (c) risk factors of being diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants. Diagnosis rates of depression in outpatient care (ICD-10 diagnosis F32/33) were analysed for the first quarter of 2004, and prescription rates of antidepressants were analysed for the first half of 2004. Odds ratios were calculated for the likelihood of being diagnosed with depression and of being prescribed antidepressants whilst considering socio-demographic and regional variables. The prevalence of depression diagnosis is up to 41% lower in East Germany than the expected mean rate and 30% above the expected mean rate in Berlin. Regional distribution rates of antidepressant prescriptions largely follow the same pattern as rates for depression diagnosis, with the exception of Berlin where prescription rates are 10% below the expected mean rate. Unemployed persons in West Germany have a higher chance of being diagnosed with depression and of being prescribed antidepressants than those unemployed in East Germany. Results correspond greatly to findings of epidemiologic surveys. However, the lower rate of depression diagnosis and prescription rates in East Germany might also be due to fewer mental health professionals practising there and possible differences in reporting style of emotional symptoms. This might contribute to the differences in diagnosis and prescription prevalence but cannot be solely responsible for this phenomenon. Probable causes of the different depression prevalence rates in East and West Germany will be discussed in this analysis.

19399175,"Differential stress-induced neuronal activation patterns in mouse lines selectively bred for high, normal or low anxiety.","There is evidence for a disturbed perception and processing of emotional information in pathological anxiety. Using a rat model of trait anxiety generated by selective breeding, we previously revealed differences in challenge-induced neuronal activation in fear/anxiety-related brain areas between high (HAB) and low (LAB) anxiety rats. To confirm whether findings generalize to other species, we used the corresponding HAB/LAB mouse model and investigated c-Fos responses to elevated open arm exposure. Moreover, for the first time we included normal anxiety mice (NAB) for comparison. The results confirm that HAB mice show hyperanxious behavior compared to their LAB counterparts, with NAB mice displaying an intermediate anxiety phenotype. Open arm challenge revealed altered c-Fos response in prefrontal-cortical, limbic and hypothalamic areas in HAB mice as compared to LAB mice, and this was similar to the differences observed previously in the HAB/LAB rat lines. In mice, however, additional differential c-Fos response was observed in subregions of the amygdala, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, midbrain and pons. Most of these differences were also seen between HAB and NAB mice, indicating that it is predominately the HAB line showing altered neuronal processing. Hypothalamic hypoactivation detected in LAB versus NAB mice may be associated with their low-anxiety/high-novelty-seeking phenotype. The detection of similarly disturbed activation patterns in a key set of anxiety-related brain areas in two independent models reflecting psychopathological states of trait anxiety confirms the notion that the altered brain activation in HAB animals is indeed characteristic of enhanced (pathological) anxiety, providing information for potential targets of therapeutic intervention.",2009,PloS one,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,"What brain regions show altered neuronal activation in pathological trait anxiety, and how does this differ between high-anxiety and low-anxiety phenotypes in animal models?","Altered activation occurs in prefrontal cortex, limbic areas, hypothalamus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, midbrain, and pons.

19375162,Effects of the LHRH antagonist Cetrorelix on the brain function in mice.,"The decapeptide Cetrorelix, an LHRH antagonist, inhibits gonadotropin and sex steroid secretion. Cetrorelix is used for IVF-ET procedures and for the treatment of patients with prostate carcinoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, endometriosis, leiomyomas and, ovarian cancer. However little is known about the effects of Cetrorelix on the brain function. In the present work the influence of Cetrorelix on different aspects of the brain function was studied following its administration into the lateral brain ventricle in mice. The effects tested included the impairment of the consolidation of a passive avoidance reflex caused by beta-amyloid 25-35, anxiolytic action in the plus-maze, antidepressive action in a forced swimming test and a tail suspension test and open-field behavior. In the passive avoidance test, beta-amyloid 25-35 administered immediately after the learning trial impaired the consolidation of passive avoidance learning. Cetrorelix fully blocked the impairment of the consolidation of passive avoidance learning when given icv 30 min following beta-amyloid 25-35 administration. If beta-amyloid 25-35 and Cetrorelix icv were given simultaneously, the Cetrorelix attenuated, but did not block the action of the beta-amyloid 25-35. Cetrorelix elicited anxiolytic action in the plus-maze, depending on the dose used. In the forced swimming and tail suspension tests, Cetrorelix demonstrated antidepressive-like action. Concerning open-field behavior, Cetrorelix displayed no action on locomotion, rearing or grooming. The results demonstrate that Cetrorelix affects brain function: and is able to correct the impairment of the memory consolidation caused by beta-amyloid 25-35. Cetrorelix also elicits anxiolytic and antidepressive action, but it does not influence the open-field activity. Further experimental work with Cetrorelix is necessary, but the results imply the possible merit of a clinical trial with Cetrorelix in patients with anxiety, depression and Alzheimer's disease.",2009-Jun,Neuropeptides,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,Which pharmacological property of Cetrorelix suggests its potential use in treating clinical anxiety disorders?,"Cetrorelix has anxiolytic action, demonstrated in the plus-maze test, which is dose-dependent.","The abstract states Cetrorelix elicited anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze test, suggesting its ability to reduce anxiety symptoms, a key characteristic relevant to clinical anxiety disorders."
20002782,The psychological status of HIV-positive people and their psychosocial experiences in eastern China.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the psychological status and the psychosocial experiences of HIV-positive people using Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90) in eastern China. Two hundred and fourteen HIV-positive people and 200 controls were recruited to the study. Participants were given an anonymous questionnaire which included questions pertaining to demography, SCL-90 and psychosocial experiences. The mean subscale scores for SCL-90 in the HIV-positive group were all higher than those of the control group (P<0.001), especially for depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and hostility. Female HIV-positive individuals had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores (P<0.05) and more scores higher than 2.0 than male HIV-positive individuals. The average number of subscales with mean scores higher than 2.0 was 4.1 for female HIV-positive individuals and 3.7 for male HIV-positive individuals. The most common psychosocial experiences related to HIV infection were fear (36.9%) and helplessness (31.8%). 90.2% of HIV-positive people would not tell others about their disease because of fear of discrimination against family members (42.2%), exclusion by community members (26.9%) and abandonment (23.3%). Discrimination from acquaintances (38.8%) was a main stressor in the HIV-positive individuals' daily life. Most members of HIV-positive individuals' communities expressed negative attitudes: alienation, coldness, aversion and fear. 38.3% of the HIV-positive participants reported that their family members had been discriminated against. The results demonstrate that HIV-positive people in eastern China live in a negative psychosocial environment and suffer from psychological distress. It is necessary to provide psychological interventions for people living with AIDS and to educate community members in order to improve the psychosocial environment.",2010-Apr,HIV medicine,"Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,"What demographic factor is associated with higher depression and anxiety scores among HIV-positive individuals, and how might this influence targeted psychological interventions?",Female gender is associated with higher depression and anxiety scores among HIV-positive individuals.,"The abstract states that female HIV-positive individuals had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores compared to males, highlighting the need for gender-specific psychological interventions."
20012009,Symptoms of depression but not anxiety are associated with central obesity and cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes: the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study.,"The aim of the study was to identify risk factors for depression and anxiety in a well-characterised cohort of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We used baseline data from participants (n = 1,066, 48.7% women, aged 67.9 +/- 4.2 years) from the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Obesity was characterised according to both overall (body mass index, fat mass) and abdominal (waist circumference) measurements. Cardiovascular disease was assessed by questionnaire, physical examination and review of medical records. Stepwise multiple linear regression was performed to identify explanatory variables related to either anxiety or depression HADS scores. Abdominal obesity (waist circumference) and cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease and ankle-brachial pressure index) were related to depression but not anxiety. Lifetime history of severe hypoglycaemia was associated with anxiety. Other cardiovascular risk factors or microvascular complications were not related to either anxiety or depressive symptoms. Depression but not anxiety is associated with abdominal obesity and cardiovascular disease in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

19059510,Longitudinal epidemiology of major depression as assessed by the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).,"Most diagnostic interviews depend on recall of past symptoms and may be vulnerable to recall bias. The objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of major depression using an approach that is less reliant on recall using an assessment scale, the 9-item Brief Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The pattern observed is relevant both to understanding major depression epidemiology and to assessing a possible role for the PHQ-9 as a screening instrument. Random digit dialing was used to select a sample of 3304 community residents. Each respondent was assessed with a baseline interview followed by a series of 6 subsequent follow-up interviews 2 weeks apart. Prevalence was between 2.5% and 3.3% during each interview, consistent with prior reports. The incidence of new episodes was surprisingly high, and many of the episodes were brief. Similarly, high rates of recovery (according to PHQ-9 scoring) were seen early in follow-up but declined subsequently. Episodes of major depression detected by the PHQ-9 tended to be preceded and followed by elevated levels of depressive symptoms. The long-standing episodes of major depression typical of clinical practice appear to represent a minority of episodes occurring in the community. These results suggest that, in general population screening applications, the PHQ-9 will identify many respondents having brief and perhaps self-limited episodes. Although some episodes are characterized by large increases in symptoms, many respondents appear to move above and below the diagnostic threshold as a result of small changes in their symptom levels. Efforts to develop more effective approaches to screening may benefit from severity-based decision rules and serial measurement strategies.",2009,Comprehensive psychiatry,Journal Article,2009,YES,sa,What are two potential limitations of using the PHQ-9 as a screening tool in general population settings for major depression?,"It may detect brief, self-limited episodes and is sensitive to small symptom changes, potentially leading to overdiagnosis or misclassification.","The abstract notes that PHQ-9 identifies brief episodes and symptom fluctuation near the diagnostic threshold, suggesting limitations in distinguishing transient episodes from clinically significant, persistent depression."
18681859,Thyroid function and the natural history of depression: findings from the Caerphilly Prospective Study (CaPS) and a meta-analysis.,"Low thyroid function has been associated with depression in clinical populations. We have examined whether thyroid function in the normal range is associated with minor psychiatric morbidity. Prospective cohort study of 2269 middle aged men (45-59 years) with thyroid function (total T(4) only, TSH unavailable) measured between 1979 and 1983 and with repeat measures of minor psychiatric morbidity (GHQ-30) over a mean of 12.3 years follow-up. We also undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies examining thyroid function and mood. There was a positive association between total T(4) and chronic psychiatric morbidity (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.02-1.43, P= 0.03), but this was consistent with chance after adjusting for social class, alcohol and smoking behaviours. The association with incident and recovery from psychiatric morbidity was weaker and consistent with chance. We identified seven eligible studies, from our systematic review and included six studies, including our own, in a meta-analysis. The pooled estimate showed a positive association (odds ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, P-value = 0.01) between depression and T(4) and an inverse association with TSH (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97, P= 0.0007) with no evidence of heterogeneity or publication bias. The results from CaPS and our meta-analysis are consistent and suggest that, if anything, higher levels of thyroxine in the normal range are associated with increased risk of depression.

19896732,Risk of chronic anxiety in implantable defibrillator patients: a multi-center study.,"Little is known about the prevalence of chronic anxiety in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). In a multi-center, prospective study, we examined 1) the prevalence of chronic anxiety (i.e., patients anxious at implantation and 12 months), and 2) predictors of chronic anxiety. ICD patients (N=284; 21.1% women) anxious (cut-off ≥ 40 on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) at the time of implantation qualified for inclusion in the current study. Patients completed the Type D Scale at baseline and the STAI (state measure) at baseline and 12 months. Of 284 patients anxious at baseline, 53.9% (153/284) remained anxious at 12-month follow-up. Diabetes (OR:2.49; 95%CI:1.16-5.36), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) (OR:2.03; 95%CI:1.02-4.05), and Type D personality (OR:1.87; 95%CI:1.09-3.19) were independent predictors of 12-month anxiety, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables including ICD therapy during follow-up. Shocks (both appropriate and inappropriate during follow-up) were not associated with chronic anxiety at 12 months (OR:0.94; 95%CI:0.42-2.12). The prevalence of chronic anxiety in the 96 patients with no risk factors was 34.4% and 63.8% in the 120 patients with either diabetes, CRT, or Type D personality. More than 50% of ICD patients anxious at the time of implantation were still anxious at 12 months, indicating a high level of chronicity.

19700134,Quality of life and depressive symptoms in heart failure patients and their partners: the impact of role and gender.,"Partners of heart failure (HF) patients are important in the course and management of the disease. It is unclear whether HF affects the quality of life (QoL) of partners as much as it affects the QoL of patients. The study aims to determine the influence of role (patient or partner) and gender on quality of life (QoL) and depressive symptoms in HF patients and their partners. Using a cross-sectional design, data on demographics, QoL, and depressive symptoms were collected from 393 HF patients (age, 68+/-11; 76% male) and their partners (age, 67+/-12; 24% male) using questionnaires (Medical Outcome Study 36-item General Health Survey [RAND-36], Cantril Ladder of Life, and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) that were send at home. At a group level HF, patients reported a significantly worse QoL and more depressive symptoms compared with their partners. When examining the influence of role and gender a significant interaction between role and gender was found. QoL in terms of general well-being of female HF partners and female HF patients did not differ (7.0 vs. 6.9), whereas male partners had a significantly higher well-being compared to male HF patients (7.6 vs. 6.8). Most of the RAND-36 domains were explained by role (either being a patient or a partner) with patients having lower scores compared with their partners. However, the RAND-36 domain mental health was mainly explained by gender, with women reporting worse mental health compared with men, independent of their role as a patient or a partner. The same trend was found for the presence of depressive symptoms. Females, either as patients or as partners are vulnerable in their response to HF in terms of their QoL. The QoL of male partners does not seem to be negatively affected. Supporting couples who are dealing with HF requires different interventions for male and female patients and their partners.",2009-Sep,Journal of cardiac failure,"Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,How does gender influence the prevalence of depressive symptoms in heart failure patients and their partners?,"Women, regardless of being patients or partners, report worse mental health and higher depressive symptoms compared to men.","The abstract identifies gender as a key factor, with women experiencing worse mental health and depressive symptoms independent of their role as patients or partners in heart failure contexts."
19207345,Computer-based psychological treatment for comorbid depression and problematic alcohol and/or cannabis use: a randomized controlled trial of clinical efficacy.,"To evaluate computer- versus therapist-delivered psychological treatment for people with comorbid depression and alcohol/cannabis use problems. Randomized controlled trial. Community-based participants in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. Ninety-seven people with comorbid major depression and alcohol/cannabis misuse. All participants received a brief intervention (BI) for depressive symptoms and substance misuse, followed by random assignment to: no further treatment (BI alone); or nine sessions of motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy (intensive MI/CBT). Participants allocated to the intensive MI/CBT condition were selected at random to receive their treatment 'live' (i.e. delivered by a psychologist) or via a computer-based program (with brief weekly input from a psychologist). Depression, alcohol/cannabis use and hazardous substance use index scores measured at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months post-baseline assessment. (i) Depression responded better to intensive MI/CBT compared to BI alone, with 'live' treatment demonstrating a strong short-term beneficial effect which was matched by computer-based treatment at 12-month follow-up; (ii) problematic alcohol use responded well to BI alone and even better to the intensive MI/CBT intervention; (iii) intensive MI/CBT was significantly better than BI alone in reducing cannabis use and hazardous substance use, with computer-based therapy showing the largest treatment effect. Computer-based treatment, targeting both depression and substance use simultaneously, results in at least equivalent 12-month outcomes relative to a 'live' intervention. For clinicians treating people with comorbid depression and alcohol problems, BIs addressing both issues appear to be an appropriate and efficacious treatment option.

Data were collected via tape-recorded semi-structured interviews. a socio-economically deprived area in North London, UK, identified as a Sure Start Local Programme providing local services specifically designed for socially disadvantaged families with children aged 0-4 years. a self-selected sample of nine women aged 23-40 years, from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, who retrospectively admitted to feeling low or depressed during pregnancy. All the participants had had a baby more than 6 weeks previously and less than 1 year before the start of the study. despite different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, the participants shared similar feelings of emotional isolation that seemed to contribute largely to their experience of antenatal depression. Partner support (or lack of it) seemed to be crucial to the women's psychological well-being during pregnancy. For some of these women, the research interview was the first opportunity to talk about their needs and feelings during pregnancy. Potentially helpful mechanisms for support were identified by the participants and were judged to be relatively simple to introduce, involving connecting with other women via peer support and having 'somewhere to go' to meet others during pregnancy. some women do not disclose their feelings of depression during pregnancy, with potentially damaging effects on both the family and the baby. Feelings of loss and emotional isolation may occur, which could be partly alleviated by providing models of midwifery care that offer continuity of carer. Isolated and vulnerable women require increased midwifery resources, and partners may also have particular needs for support and adjustment, which currently remain unmet and need further research.

This study evaluates stigma among 277 Mozambicans who were on an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens for a full year. Using bivariate and multiple regression analyses, we examine psychosocial factors (disclosure decisions, perceived social support, and depression) associated with stigma, at ART initiation and 1 year later. We found 1 year after initiating ART, participants reported no change in stigma, a decrease in perceived social support, and an increase in depressive symptomology. Disclosing HIV status to friends (versus family or partner) was associated with lower levels of stigma.

Depression was determined by responses to the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-21) and by Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Higher scores on BDI-21 were related to higher CRP levels (beta = 0.12, p < .001) in men and (beta = 0.08, p < .001) in women. In men, but not in women, this relationship persisted after adjustment for a number of other known risk factors.

19527825,Safflower extracts functionally regulate monoamine transporters.,"Safflower (HH), the dry flower of Carthamus tinctorius L., has long been used to empirically treat neuropsychological disorders such as stroke and major depression in traditional Chinese medicine, and recently been proven effective for regulating levels of dopamine and serotonin in new-born rat brain. The present study assessed whether HH would be bioactive for functionally regulating monoamine transporters using in vitro drug-screening cell lines. Our current results showed that all solvent-extracted HH fractions, in different degrees, markedly increased both dopamine uptake by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine uptake by CHO cells expressing norepinephrine transporter (NET), and also showed that chloroform (HC), ethyl acetate (HE), and n-butyl alcohol extract strikingly depressed serotonin uptake by CHO cells expressing serotonin transporter (SERT); wherein, the potencies of ethanol extract, HC, HE, and aqueous extract to up-regulate dopamine/norepinephrine uptake and potency of HE to inhibit serotonin uptake were relatively stronger. Further investigation revealed that the enhancement of dopamine/norepinephrine uptake by HC and HE was dependent of DAT/NET activity, and the HE-induced inhibition of serotonin uptake was typical of competition. Thus, HH extracts are novel monoamine transporter modulators functioning as DAT/NET activators and/or SERT inhibitors, and would likely improve neuropsychological disorders through regulating monoamine-transporter activity.",2009-Jul-06,Journal of ethnopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,How might an extract that inhibits serotonin transporter (SERT) activity and enhances dopamine transporter (DAT) activity be relevant in the treatment of clinical depression?,"It could increase serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft while enhancing dopamine regulation, potentially improving mood and motivation.","The abstract highlights that HH extracts inhibit SERT (increasing serotonin availability) and activate DAT (enhancing dopamine uptake), both of which are pathways implicated in alleviating symptoms of clinical depression, such as low mood and anhedonia."
18587666,Chronic intermittent cold stress and serotonin depletion induce deficits of reversal learning in an attentional set-shifting test in rats.,"Chronic stress perturbs modulatory brain neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin (5-HT), and is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders such as depression. Deficits in cognitive flexibility, reflecting prefrontal cortical dysfunction, are prominent in such disorders. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated specifically in reversal learning, a form of cognitive flexibility modulated by 5-HT. The objectives of the study were (1) to assess the effects of chronic intermittent cold (CIC) stress, a potent metabolic stressor, on performance of rats in an attentional set-shifting test (AST), and (2) to assess a possible role for serotonin in CIC-induced deficits and test the effects of acute serotonin reuptake blockade. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CIC stress (14 days x 6 h/day at 4 degrees C) before testing on the AST. In subsequent experiments, brain 5-HT was depleted in naïve rats with para-chlorophenylalanine or 5-HT release was increased acutely in CIC-stressed rats with citalopram (5 mg/kg, s.c.) given 30 min prior to the first reversal task. Microdialysis was used to assess CIC-induced changes in 5-HT release in OFC during testing. CIC-stressed rats exhibited a selective impairment on the first reversal task in the AST. 5-HT depletion induced a similarly selective deficit in reversal learning. The CIC-induced impairment in reversal learning was attenuated by acute 5-HT reuptake blockade. 5-HT release was reduced in OFC of CIC-stressed rats during behavioral testing. The CIC stress-induced impairment of cognitive flexibility may involve dysregulation of 5-HT modulatory function in OFC. Such deficits may thus model relevant symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders that respond positively to SSRI treatment.",2009-Jan,Psychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,"How might chronic intermittent cold (CIC) stress impair cognitive flexibility in a way that models symptoms of depression, and what pharmacological intervention could mitigate these effects?",CIC stress impairs cognitive flexibility by reducing serotonin release in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).

20140122,The effect of cognitive behavior therapy-based psychotherapy applied in a forest environment on physiological changes and remission of major depressive disorder.,"Psychotherapeutic intervention combined with pharmacotherapy is helpful for achieving remission of depressive disorder. We developed and tested the effect of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based psychotherapy applied in a forest environment on major depressive disorder. We performed 4 sessions during 4 weeks (3 hours/session) in patients with major depressive disorder during pharmacotherapy. For the forest group, sessions were performed in the forest; for the hospital group, sessions were performed in the hospital. The control group was treated with the usual outpatient management. A total of 63 patients completed the study: 23 in the forest group, 19 in the hospital group, and 21 in the control group. Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression (HRSD) scores of the forest group were significantly decreased after 4 sessions compared with controls. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales (MADRS) scores of the forest group were significantly decreased compared with both the hospital group and the controls. The remission rate (7 and below in HRSD) of the forest group was 61% (14/23), significantly higher than both the hospital group (21%, 4/19) and the controls (5%, 1/21). In heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, some measurements representing HRV and parasympathetic nerve tone were increased in the forest group after 4 sessions. The salivary cortisol levels of the forest group were significantly decreased. CBT-based psychotherapy applied in the forest environment was helpful in the achievement of depression remission, and its effect was superior to that of psychotherapy performed in the hospital and the usual outpatient management.

19004504,Self-medication of mood disorders with alcohol and drugs in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.,"Using alcohol or drugs to reduce emotional distress (self-medication) has been proposed as an explanation for the high comorbidity rates between anxiety and substance use disorders. Self-medication has been minimally studied in mood disorders despite equally high rates of alcohol and drug use. Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large (n=43,093, age 18 years and older) nationally representative survey of mental illness in community-dwelling adults. Prevalence rates of self-medication were determined for DSM-IV mood disorders: dysthymia, major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder. Multiple logistic regression generated odds ratios for the association between each category of self-medication and anxiety and personality disorders. Almost one-quarter of individuals with mood disorders (24.1%) used alcohol or drugs to relieve symptoms. The highest prevalence of self-medication was seen in bipolar I disorder (41.0%). Men were more than twice as likely as women to engage in self-medication (Adjusted Odds Ratio=2.18; 95% Confidence Interval 1.90-2.49). After controlling for the effects of substance use disorders, self-medication was associated with higher odds of comorbid anxiety and personality disorders when compared to individuals who did not self-medicate. Cross-sectional design. The use of alcohol and drugs to relieve affective symptoms is common among individuals with mood disorders in the general population, yet is associated with substantial psychiatric comorbidity. These findings may help clinicians identify a subgroup of people with mood disorders who suffer from a higher mental illness burden.",2009-Jun,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2009,YES,sa,"What subgroup of individuals with mood disorders is at the highest risk for using alcohol or drugs to alleviate their symptoms, and what additional psychiatric comorbidities are they more likely to have?","Individuals with bipolar I disorder are at the highest risk for self-medication, and they are more likely to have comorbid anxiety and personality disorders.","The abstract identifies bipolar I disorder as having the highest self-medication prevalence (41.0%) and associates self-medication with higher odds of comorbid anxiety and personality disorders, even after controlling for substance use disorders."
19829200,Influence of personality on objective and subjective social support among patients with major depressive disorder: a prospective study.,"Personality and social support (SS) influence risk for depression and modify its outcome through multiple pathways. The impact of personality dimensions neuroticism and extraversion on SS among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) has been little studied. In the Vantaa Depression Study, we assessed neuroticism and extraversion with the Eysenck Personality Inventory, objective SS with the Interview Measure of Social Relationships, and subjective SS with the Perceived Social Support Scale-Revised at baseline, at 6 and 18 months among 193 major depressive disorder patients diagnosed according to the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DMS-IV). At all time-points, low neuroticism and high extraversion associated significantly with between-subject differences in levels of objective and subjective SS. Lower neuroticism (beta = 0.213, p = 0.003) and higher extraversion (beta = 0.159, p = 0.038) predicted greater within-subject change of subjective, but not objective SS. Thus, neuroticism and extraversion associated with the size of objective and subjective SS and predicted change of subjective SS.

19144502,Objective: remission of depression in primary care The Oreon Study.,"Treatment of depression should result in the absence of symptoms, i.e. remission, in order to restore the functional status of the patient and reduce the risk for relapse. The study assessed the current remission rates in primary care and determined the influencing factors. 10 consecutive depressive patients treated by antidepressants for at least 3 months and not more than 12 months were screened by each investigator. Remission rates were defined using the Hamilton-Depression scale 7 items (score of 3 or less) as well as the Carroll self rating scale (score of 7 or less). In addition, patients completed the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Initial severity of depression, type of treatment and socio-economic factors were collected. 292 general practitioners screened a total of 2630 patients. Results indicated low remission rates: 28.3% according to the clinician and 17.1% according to the patient. Absence of remission was associated with higher impairment in work, social and family life. The most frequently reported residual symptoms in nonremitters were general somatic symptoms (92%), depressed mood (92%), psychic anxiety (91%) and impaired work and activities (89%). No differences were observed in remission rates between men and women. Remission rates were significantly lower in patients living alone as compared to those living in couple or family (25.1% vs 30.2%, p=0.03), in patients with lower education (21.3% vs 32.3%, p<0.001), in patients speaking French as compared to Dutch (24.0% vs 34.0% p<0.001), and unemployed patients compared to patients having an occupation (17.1% vs 39.0%, p<0.001). Higher initial severity and number of previous episodes decreased remission rates (p<0.001). This study shows low remission rates in depressed patients treated in general practice.

19906342,Outcome of patients with major depressive disorder after serious suicide attempt.,"To investigate the outcome of subjects with major depressive disorder after serious suicide attempt and to examine the effect of psychotic symptoms on their outcome. The study population included all individuals aged 16 years or older in Finland who were hospitalized with ICD-10 diagnoses of major depressive disorder and attempted suicide from 1996 to 2003 (N = 1,820). The main outcome measures were completed suicides, overall mortality, and repeated suicide attempts during drug treatment versus no treatment. During the 4-year follow-up period, 13% of patients died, 6% completed suicide, and 31% made a repeat suicide attempt. Subjects with major depression with psychotic features completed suicide more often than subjects without psychotic features during the follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] 3.32; 95% CI, 1.95 - 5.67). Antidepressant treatment reduced all-cause mortality by 24% (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56 - 0.97) but did not reduce suicide mortality (HR 1.06; 95% CI, 0.71 - 1.58).

19657730,Yoga ameliorates performance anxiety and mood disturbance in young professional musicians.,"Yoga and meditation can alleviate stress, anxiety, mood disturbance, and musculoskeletal problems, and can enhance cognitive and physical performance. Professional musicians experience high levels of stress, performance anxiety, and debilitating performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). The goal of this controlled study was to evaluate the benefits of yoga and meditation for musicians. Young adult professional musicians who volunteered to participate in a 2-month program of yoga and meditation were randomized to a yoga lifestyle intervention group (n = 15) or to a group practicing yoga and meditation only (n = 15). Additional musicians were recruited to a no-practice control group (n = 15). Both yoga groups attended three Kripalu Yoga or meditation classes each week. The yoga lifestyle group also experienced weekly group practice and discussion sessions as part of their more immersive treatment. All participants completed baseline and end-program self-report questionnaires that evaluated music performance anxiety, mood, PRMDs, perceived stress, and sleep quality; many participants later completed a 1-year followup assessment using the same questionnaires. Both yoga groups showed a trend towards less music performance anxiety and significantly less general anxiety/tension, depression, and anger at end-program relative to controls, but showed no changes in PRMDs, stress, or sleep. Similar results in the two yoga groups, despite psychosocial differences in their interventions, suggest that the yoga and meditation techniques themselves may have mediated the improvements. Our results suggest that yoga and meditation techniques can reduce performance anxiety and mood disturbance in young professional musicians.",2009-Dec,Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback,"Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,What non-pharmacological intervention could significantly reduce general anxiety and mood disturbances in young professional musicians without addressing musculoskeletal disorders or sleep issues?,Yoga and meditation techniques.,"The abstract reports that yoga and meditation significantly reduced general anxiety, depression, and anger in musicians, but did not affect musculoskeletal disorders or sleep quality, suggesting their primary efficacy in mood and anxiety management."
19403786,Is depression associated with health risk-related behaviour clusters in adults?,"Depressive disorders have been linked to health risk-related behaviours (HRBs) considered separately. Our objective was to study whether depression is associated with the co-occurrence of HRBs in adults. A sample of 17 355 subjects aged > or =18 years, derived from the 2002-03 cross-sectional Decennial Health Survey; probable depression was assessed with the CES-D scale. A cluster analysis of various HRBs (tobacco use, alcohol use, binge drinking, physical inactivity, certain eating habits) was used to study their co-occurrence. Multiple regressions adjusted on demographic and socio-economic characteristics, Body Mass Index and chronic illnesses were performed to study associations between probable depression and the HRBs clusters obtained. Five clusters were observed evidencing a gradient of cumulative exposure to HRBs: 'healthy lifestyles (Cluster 1), 'non-daily-consumers-fruit-and-green-vegetables' (Cluster 2), 'regular alcohol users' (Cluster 3), 'daily smokers' (Cluster 4) and 'cumulate risk takers' (Cluster 5). Compared with Cluster 1, positive associations were found between probable depression and Clusters 2, 4 and 5: OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.26-1.76) for Cluster 2; OR 1.81 (95% CI 1.54-2.12) for Cluster 4; OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.68-2.51) for Cluster 5. For Cluster 3, no association was found: OR 1.01 (95% CI 0.84-1.21). HRBs tend to co-occur in the general population, more frequently in case of probable depression. Further research is necessary to disentangle the direction of the links between depression and HRB clusters. Nonetheless, these results question the classic design of education campaigns considering HRBs separately. Moreover, screening for depression should be systematic during prevention consultations and various HRBs should be monitored when treating depressive patients.",2009-Dec,European journal of public health,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,"Which health-risk behavior cluster is most strongly associated with probable depression, and why should depression screening be systematic in prevention consultations?",Cluster 5 ('cumulate risk takers') is most strongly associated.

19803572,Battlemind debriefing and battlemind training as early interventions with soldiers returning from iraq: Randomization by platoon.,"Researchers have found that there is an increase in mental heath problems as a result of military-related traumatic events, and such problems increase in the months following return from combat. Nevertheless, researchers have not assessed the impact of early intervention efforts with this at-risk population. In the present study, the authors compared different early interventions with 2,297 U.S. soldiers following a year-long deployment to Iraq. Platoons were randomly assigned to standard postdeployment stress education, Battlemind debriefing, and small and large group Battlemind training. Results from a 4-month follow-up with 1,060 participants showed those with high levels of combat exposure who received Battlemind debriefing reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression symptoms, and sleep problems than those in stress education. Small group Battlemind training participants with high combat exposure reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms and sleep problems than stress education participants. Compared to stress education participants, large group Battlemind training participants with high combat exposure reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms and lower levels of stigma and, regardless of combat exposure, reported fewer depression symptoms. Findings demonstrate that brief early interventions have the potential to be effective with at-risk occupational groups.",2009-Oct,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,2009,YES,sa,Which early intervention format reduced both depression symptoms and stigma in soldiers with high combat exposure?,Large group Battlemind training.,The abstract states that large group Battlemind training reduced depression symptoms and stigma in soldiers with high combat exposure compared to stress education participants.
19272208,Oxidative stress in depressive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma.,"Recent data from several studies suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the biochemical mechanisms that underlie neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study was designed to investigate oxidative stress status in depressive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) at TNM stage III. Oxidative stress, depression and expression of specific genes were monitored during a pretreatment period. Serum total antioxidant capacity, catalase, superoxide dismutase concentrations, and antisuperoxide anion capacity (A-ASC) were significantly decreased in depressive patients compared to control subjects, whereas serum malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly increased. Importantly, the formation of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) accumulated. Furthermore, SYBR Green real-time PCR revealed that the expression levels of human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 and APEX nuclease 1 (APEX1) were increased in depressive patients. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that depression was positively correlated with SAS, SCL-90, MDA, 8-OHdG and APEX1, but negatively correlated with A-ASC. Thus, this study confirms oxidative imbalance in depressive patients with GA, and oxidative stress may play a role in the onset and exacerbation of depression.",2009-Sep,The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,Which oxidative stress biomarkers are elevated and which are decreased in depressive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma at TNM stage III?,"Elevated: malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG); Decreased: total antioxidant capacity, catalase, superoxide dismutase, antisuperoxide anion capacity (A-ASC).","The abstract reports increased serum MDA and 8-OHdG levels, indicating oxidative damage, while antioxidant markers (total antioxidant capacity, catalase, superoxide dismutase, A-ASC) were decreased, reflecting impaired oxidative defense in depressive patients with gastric adenocarcinoma."
19926442,The effect of single-session interpretation modification on attention bias in socially anxious individuals.,"Research suggests that individuals with social anxiety interpret ambiguous social information negatively (e.g., Amir, Foa, & Coles, 1998) and that much negative interpretation bias may share a common mechanism with other information processing biases (e.g., Mathews, Mackintosh, & Fulcher, 1997). In the current study, we examined effectiveness of an Interpretation Modification Program in changing attention biases in socially anxious individuals. Participants were randomly assigned to either an Interpretation Modification Program (IMP) that guided them to make benign interpretations of ambiguous social scenarios or an Interpretation Control Condition (ICC) that did not guide participants' interpretation in either direction. Results revealed that individuals in the IMP group demonstrated greater ability to disengage attention from threat stimuli after completing the program, while individuals in the ICC did not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that information processing biases in anxious individuals may share a common mechanism that may contribute to the maintenance of anxiety.",2010-Mar,Journal of anxiety disorders,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2009,YES,sa,How might targeting interpretation biases in socially anxious individuals influence their attention bias toward threat stimuli?,It may improve their ability to disengage attention from threat stimuli.,"The abstract states that an Interpretation Modification Program (IMP) promoting benign interpretations of ambiguous scenarios led to improved disengagement from threat stimuli, suggesting a link between interpretation biases and attention biases in social anxiety."
19608282,Suicide attempt characteristics may orientate toward a bipolar disorder in attempters with recurrent depression.,"Identification of patients with a bipolar disorder (BPD) among those presenting a major depressive episode is often difficult, resulting in common misdiagnosis and mistreatment. Our aim was to identify clinical variables unrelated to current depressive episode and relevant to suicidal behavior that may help to improve the detection of BPD in suicide attempters presenting with recurrent major depressive disorder. 211 patients suffering from recurrent major depressive disorder or BPD, hospitalized after a suicide attempt (SA), were interviewed by semi-structured interview and validated questionnaires about DSM-IV axis I disorders, SA characteristics and a wide range of personality traits relevant to suicidal vulnerability. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine differences between RMDD and BPD attempters. Logistic regression analysis showed that serious SA and family history of suicide are closely associated with a diagnosis of BPD [respectively OR=2.28, p=0.0195; OR=2.98, p=0.0081]. The presence of both characteristics increase the association with BDP [OR=4.78, p=0.005]. Conversely, when looking for the features associated with a serious SA, BPD was the only associated diagnosis [OR=2.03, p=0.004]. Lastly, affect intensity was higher in BPD samples [OR=2.08, p=0.041]. Retrospective nature of the study, lack of the separate analysis of bipolar subtypes. Serious suicide attempt and a familial history of completed suicide in patients with major depression seem to be a clinical marker of bipolarity.

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from February 2006 to May 2007. Patients aged 18 through 65 years with MDD (DSM-IV criteria) and a baseline 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score of >or= 22 were randomly assigned to vilazodone or placebo for 8 weeks. Vilazodone was titrated from 10 mg to 40 mg once a day over 2 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by mean change from baseline to week 8 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), HAM-D-17, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. Response rates were determined at week 8 for the MADRS, HAM-D-17, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Data were analyzed using a modified last-observation-carried-forward method in the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample. The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) was also measured at baseline and week 8. Of 410 randomly assigned patients, 198 receiving vilazodone and 199 receiving placebo were included in the ITT population. The mean changes in MADRS and HAM-D-17 total scores from baseline to week 8 were significantly (p = .001 and p = .022, respectively) greater with vilazodone than with placebo. Significant (p < .05) improvements in MADRS and HAM-D-17 scores were noted at week 1, the earliest time point measured.

19501413,Association of depressive phenotype with affective family history is mediated by affective temperaments.,"Increasing data support an association of cyclothymic temperament with bipolarity, but our knowledge about the relationship of affective temperaments (ATs) to depressive symptoms based on inheritance in a non-clinical population is limited. The aim of this article was to demonstrate how ATs and affective family history relate to the depressive symptoms in a general population. Subjects comprised 501 Hungarian adults who completed a background questionnaire, the TEMPS-A, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) and the depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-D). Stepwise linear regression was performed to analyse the role of ATs and affective family history (AFH(0) and AFH(1)) in the variance of ZSDS and BSI-D scores. Cyclothymic, depressive and anxious temperaments have a significant role in the explained variance of depression scores, and they are all significantly related to AFH(1). Significant differences were found between AFH(1) and AFH(0) groups in ZSDS and BSI-D scores, and these effects were eliminated if ATs were entered as covariates. The probability of having any dominant temperament was more than two-fold in group AFH(1) compared with AFH(0) (OR=2.33).

21509269,Silent Epidemic of Depression in Women in the Middle East and North Africa Region: Emerging tribulation or fallacy?,"As the world is being gripped by economic depression, international psychological epidemiologists have amassed evidence to suggest that psychological depression and its variants are becoming leading contributors to the global burden of disease with the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region being no exception. The main aim of the present discourse, based on a review of the available literature, is to discuss critically whether women in the MENA region have a higher rate of psychological depression than those in other parts of the globe. From the present synthesis, it emerges that the rate of depression may not be necessarily unique to the region. Although no society has totally overcome the marginalisation and lack of empowerment of women, in order to come to grips to this complex issue more vigorously designed epidemiological studies, using taxonomies that are standardised for cross-cultural populations, are needed to quantify the psychological functioning of women.",2009-Apr,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,Journal Article,2009,YES,sa,What methodological limitation could hinder the accurate comparison of depression rates among women in the MENA region versus other global populations?,Lack of standardised cross-cultural taxonomies for measuring psychological functioning.,"The abstract highlights the need for rigorously designed studies using standardised taxonomies to ensure accurate comparisons of depression rates across different populations, including women in the MENA region."
19786424,Mental health context of food insecurity: a representative cohort of families with young children.,"Children from food-insecure families (ie, families that lack access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food) are at risk for developmental problems. Food insecurity disproportionately occurs among low-socioeconomic status (SES) and low-income families; however, interventions that supplement families' income or diet have not eradicated food insecurity. This may be because food insecurity is also related to nonfinancial factors such as the presence of maternal mental health problems. To clarify whether addressing mothers' mental health problems may be a promising strategy for reducing the burden of food insecurity, we tested the hypothesis that low-SES families are especially vulnerable to food insecurity when the mother experiences depression, alcohol or drug abuse, psychosis spectrum disorder, or domestic violence. We used data from a nationally representative cohort of 1116 British families (the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Study). Food insecurity, family SES, maternal mental health and exposure to domestic violence, and children's behavioral outcomes were measured by using validated methods. Overall, 9.7% of study families were food-insecure. Among low-SES families, controlling for income variation, food insecurity co-occurred with maternal depression (odds ratio [OR]: 2.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62-4.93]), psychosis spectrum disorder (OR: 4.01 [95% CI: 2.03-7.94]), and domestic violence (OR: 2.36 [95% CI: 1.18-4.73]). In addition, food insecurity predicted elevated rates of children's behavior problems. Among families with young children, food insecurity is frequent, particularly when the mother experiences mental health problems. This suggests that interventions that improve women's mental health may also contribute to decreasing the burden of food insecurity and its impact on the next generation.",2009-Oct,Pediatrics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,"In low-socioeconomic status families, how might maternal clinical depression indirectly contribute to children's behavioral problems?","Maternal depression increases the risk of food insecurity, which predicts elevated rates of children's behavioral problems.","The abstract states maternal depression in low-SES families is associated with food insecurity, which in turn predicts increased behavioral problems in children, highlighting an indirect pathway."
19680791,Parent-teen interactions as predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents with headache.,"This study investigated parent-adolescent conflict, family functioning, and adolescent autonomy as predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents with primary headache. Frequent headaches during adolescence can have a negative impact on activity levels and psychological functioning. Depression is particularly prevalent in adolescents with headache but little research has examined the role of parent-teen interactions in predicting depressive symptoms. Thirty adolescents diagnosed with migraine or chronic daily headache completed self-report measures of pain intensity, parent-adolescent conflict, family functioning, and depression. Adolescents and their parents also participated in three videotaped interaction tasks, scored by independent raters to assess adolescent autonomy. Regression models revealed that pain intensity, parent-adolescent conflict, and autonomy predicted depressive symptoms. Higher levels of conflict, poorer family functioning and lower levels of autonomy were associated with more depressive symptoms. This study highlights the association between parent-teen interactions and psychological functioning in adolescents with primary headache.

20097012,Measurement invariance of alcohol use motivations in junior military personnel at risk for depression or anxiety.,"Measurement invariance is typically assumed when assessing drinking-related constructs across distinct groups of respondents. However, measurement properties of motivations related to mood maintenance and stress relief may differ in those experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety. Invariance of social and coping drinking motives were explored with a sample of 4133 junior enlisted Air Force and Navy personnel. Measurement did not differ in those with depression symptoms. In contrast, those with anxiety symptoms differed in measurement of both motives. The impact of non-equivalence was demonstrated with a mediation model in which anxiety and depression predicted drinking motives, which in turn predicted heavy drinking. Incorporation of the partial invariance of the social motives factor attenuated the estimate of the mediated effect of social drinking motives by almost half compared to the estimate with invariance assumed.

19732244,Investigating factors associated with depression of older women in Macau.,"Mental health burdens pose a grave threat to quality of life and economic productivity worldwide. Women must balance the economic, emotional and health needs of the household with their own emotional and health needs. The purpose of this study is to explore the depression level of a group of older women in the community in Macau, and to identify factors associated with depression. A descriptive survey. The survey was conducted during the period July and August 2004 in six parishes in Macau; 1042 older people aged 60-98 completed a structured questionnaire. Four main outcome variables were employed in the study: predisposing characteristics, physical, psychosocial and health needs/behaviours outcomes. Among the women, 11.9% (n = 124) had been identified as depressed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify a model to predict older women who will have depression. The results showed that variables like having hypertension (p = 0.010), a poor social network (p < 0.001), low self-perceived scores on health status (p < 0.001) and ability to meet living costs (p < 0.001), and a low level of ability to do housework (p < 0.001) were significant risk factors for depression. Providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms, and maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms. Apart from the findings, these conclusions resonate with recent Macau guidance on managing depression in older women. This stresses the importance of prevention, early detection and stepped care, with more intensive treatment for greater severity of illness and a multifaceted approach to management. It is important to regularly screen for depressive symptoms among older women in the community. Focusing on older women with increasing physical disability and social isolation should help in both the prevention and recognition of onset of depression. Light therapy and antidepressants were suggested and providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms; maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms.",2009-Nov,Journal of clinical nursing,Journal Article,2009,YES,sa,What are two modifiable risk factors for depression in older women that clinicians should address to reduce depressive symptoms?,Poor social network and low self-perceived health status.,"The abstract identifies a poor social network and low self-perceived health status as significant risk factors for depression in older women, suggesting these are modifiable areas clinicians can target to reduce depressive symptoms."
19732483,Childhood adversities and adult psychopathology in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) III: associations with functional impairment related to DSM-IV disorders.,"Despite evidence that childhood adversities (CAs) are associated with increased risk of mental disorders, little is known about their associations with disorder-related impairment. We report the associations between CAs and functional impairment associated with 12-month DSM-IV disorders in a national sample. We used data from the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Respondents completed diagnostic interviews that assessed 12-month DSM-IV disorder prevalence and impairment. Associations of 12 retrospectively reported CAs with impairment among cases (n=2242) were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Impairment measures included a dichotomous measure of classification in the severe range of impairment on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and a measure of self-reported number of days out of role due to emotional problems in the past 12 months. CAs were positively and significantly associated with impairment. Predictive effects of CAs on the SDS were particularly pronounced for anxiety disorders and were significant in predicting increased days out of role associated with mood, anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders. Predictive effects persisted throughout the life course and were not accounted for by disorder co-morbidity. CAs associated with maladaptive family functioning (MFF; parental mental illness, substance disorder, criminality, family violence, abuse, neglect) were more consistently associated with impairment than other CAs. The joint effects of co-morbid MFF CAs were significantly subadditive. Simulations suggest that CAs account for 19.6% of severely impairing disorders and 17.4% of days out of role. CAs predict greater disorder-related impairment, highlighting the ongoing clinical significance of CAs at every stage of the life course.",2010-May,Psychological medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2009,YES,sa,How do childhood adversities involving maladaptive family functioning impact impairment in individuals with clinical anxiety disorders?,"They are strongly associated with increased functional impairment, particularly severe impairment measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale and increased days out of role.","The abstract states that maladaptive family functioning childhood adversities are consistently linked to greater impairment, with pronounced effects for anxiety disorders, persisting across the life course and independent of co-morbidity."

19579172,Evidence for IL-1 receptor blockade as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of depression.,"Uncontrollable stress, a major precipitant of depression in humans and in animal paradigms, impairs hippocampal neurogenesis, which is necessary for the behavioral effects of antidepressants in models of depression that require chronic treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying these anti-neurogenic and behavioral effects of stress have not been elucidated. Proinflammatory cytokines are thought to be contributing factors to stress and have been implicated in stress-related mood disorders such as major depression. In particular, IL-1 beta has been proposed to be a key mediator in a variety of behavioral actions of stress. Notably, the administration of a IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) blocks the stress-like effects of IL-1 beta in both cellular and behavioral models.

However, PD patients experience a multitude of debilitating non-motor symptoms, including depression, which may have deleteriously detrimental effects on life. Depression is multifactorial and exhibits a bimodal progression in PD, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Studies demonstrating the pathophysiology of depression in PD and the specific treatment strategies for depression-like symptoms in PD patients are largely lacking, often underrated, under-recognized and, consequently, inadequately/under-treated. Nevertheless, reports suggest that the incidence of depression is approximately 20-30% of PD patients and may precede the onset of motor symptoms. Diagnosing depression in PD becomes difficult due to the clinical overlap in symptomatology between the two diseases, and the nigrostriatal dysfunction alone is insufficient to explain depressive symptoms in PD. Therefore, the current study provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of depression in PD and new insights into developing current antidepressant strategies to treat depression in PD.

37990838,Relations between concussion symptoms and depression among patients with mild traumatic brain injury: A moderated mediation model.,"Concussion symptoms following a traumatic accident are both common and known to adversely affect mental health and recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury. Depression, highly prevalent among patients with traumatic brain injury, is also associated with the important factors of sleep quality and resilience. However, the mediator and moderator roles of depression following concussion in patients with traumatic brain injury have been underexplored. The aims of this study were to investigate the mediating role of sleep quality in the relation between concussion symptoms and depression and to examine the moderating effect of resilience on this mediated model. Cross-sectional pretest data analysis of a randomized controlled trial. A total of 249 adult patients with mild traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15) at admission following brain injury were surveyed at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The outcome variables were concussion symptoms (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), resilience (Resilience Scale for Adults), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory II). These data were analyzed using moderated mediation regressions with the SPSS PROCESS macro. In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, there was a significant positive relation between concussion symptoms and depression, of which sleep quality was a significant mediator. Additionally, resilience had a negative moderating effect on the relations between sleep quality and depression. Patients with less resilience showed a stronger negative effect of sleep quality on depression. Our findings suggest that ameliorating both concussion symptoms and sleep disturbance is important for reducing the risk of depression in patients with mild traumatic brain injury, especially in those patients with less resilience.

Therefore, we explored how mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms, and emotion regulation strategies of expressive suppression and cognitive reappraisal can contribute to caregiving helplessness during toddlerhood. We also examined whether depression and anxiety can mediate the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and caregiving helplessness. A sample of 552 healthy Turkish mothers (<i>MAge</i> = 32.11) with 1-4 year old healthy children (<i>MAge</i> = 1.51) replied to advertisements we shared face-to-face and filled out a pack of questionnaires including a demographic form, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory and Caregiving Helplessness Questionnaire. A series of path analysis were conducted to reveal the association between emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression), depression and anxiety symptoms, and caregiving helplessness. After controlling for socio-economic status (SES), maternal anxiety but not maternal depression positively predicted caregiving helplessnes. Unlike cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression positively predicted caregiving helplessness. SES had an indirect effect (via suppression) on caregiving helplessness on caregiving helplessness.

The distribution of medical colleges is disproportionately concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural populations without quality health care. The mental well-being of physicians is a growing concern, with studies indicating high levels of burnout, stress, and depression among healthcare workers, worsened by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Rising suicide rates among medical professionals highlight the severity of burnout and depression in the healthcare sector. Factors contributing to this crisis include inadequate recruitment in government hospitals, a shortage of healthcare professionals, and inefficiencies in resource distribution. Attacks on physicians have become alarmingly frequent, necessitating comprehensive studies to understand the challenges faced by different specialties and the impact of rural versus urban settings. To address these issues, prompt filling of vacant positions in government hospitals and prioritizing physicians' mental health is crucial. The government should offer competitive salaries, effective management, and supportive working environments to combat the brain drain. Initiatives inspiring professionals to stay in Nepal, along with maintaining the National Health Insurance Program and controlling healthcare privatization, are necessary. Resilience training, professional programs, and improved infrastructure in government medical colleges are vital.

37410421,Impact of warm mindfulness on emotion regulation: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial.,"To determine the effects of mindfulness training for primary care (MTPC), an integrated warm mindfulness training program, on emotion regulation and its relationship with health behavior change. Interventions that improve self-regulation, particularly emotion regulation, are needed for the self-management of comorbid chronic physical and mental illnesses. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) may impact self-regulation and facilitate health behavior change. A randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial was conducted in a population of adult primary care patients to evaluate the impact of MTPC versus a low-dose mindfulness comparator (LDC) on self-reported difficulties in emotion regulation (DERS) total score and other assays of self-regulation at baseline, Weeks 8 and 24. Self-reported action plan initiation was reported between Weeks 8 and 10. Participants had diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or stress-related disorders. MTPC is an 8-week insurance-reimbursable warm MBI designed to cultivate mindfulness and self-compassion and to catalyze chronic illness self-management related health behavior change. Compared to LDC, MTPC participants had statistically significant reductions in DERS total score at 8 weeks (d = -0.59, β = -12.98, 95% CI [-23.3 to -2.6]; p = .01) and 24 weeks (d = -0.61, β = -13.35, [-24.3, -2.4]; p = .02).

37743126,Anxiety is Associated With Geriatric Assessment Impairments and Reduced Quality of Life Among Older Adults With Colorectal Cancer: Results From the CARE Registry.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) preferentially affects older adults. Modifiable factors, such as anxiety, can be measured as part of cancer-specific geriatric assessments (GA) completed prior to the start of treatment. We hypothesized that anxiety is prevalent among older adults with CRC and is associated with increased depression, increased frailty, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Patients ≥60 years old with newly diagnosed CRC completed a cancer-specific GA called the Cancer and Aging Resilience Evaluation (CARE). Between September 2017 and February 2023, we analyzed patients with CRC who had not yet received any systemic treatment. Anxiety was assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety 4-item short form and reported as t-scores. We used modified Poisson models with robust variance estimation to assess for differences in the prevalence of depression, frailty, and impaired HRQOL. We analyzed 277 older adults with CRC. The median age of the study sample was 68 years. 57% were male, 72% were non-Hispanic White, and most had advanced CRC (35% stage III and 39% stage IV). Moderate/severe anxiety was present in 17% of older adults with newly diagnosed CRC. In adjusted models, as compared to patients without moderate/severe anxiety, patients with moderate/severe anxiety had significantly increased risk of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 7.60, CI 4.90-11.78), frailty (PR 4.93, CI 3.01-8.07), impaired physical HRQOL (PR 3.57, CI 2.03-6.28), and impaired mental HRQOL (PR 3.82, CI 2.12-6.89).

35724682,[Attitudes of Mental Health Experts Towards Psilocybin].,"In recent years, studies investigating the use of psilocybin to treat mental disorders have shown promising results. In this context, this online survey investigated attitudes of trained psychiatrists and psychotherapists towards psilocybin and psilocybin-assisted therapies. A total of 530 valid responses from individuals with suitable job profiles were collected in this online survey. Statistical analysis was used to identify relevant predictors of attitude measures. The opinions of experts in the treatment of mental disorders with psilocybin and psilocybin-assisted therapies varied widely, and the level of knowledge of the participants to some extent was low. A large number of participants considered treatment of mental disorders with psilocybin to be promising and treatment of depression with psilocybin was seen as promising by the majority of the participants. The results of this study suggest that a higher level of knowledge about psilocybin is associated with more optimistic views about its use in a therapeutic setting. Having additional scientific information led in some cases to more optimistic attitudes towards psilocybin and the use of psilocybin in the treatment of mental disorders. If the scientific and public discourse on psilocybin continues to grow in the future, changes in the attitudes of psychotherapists and psychiatrists can be expected.",2023-Mar,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,English Abstract; Journal Article,2023,YES,sa,What factor is associated with more optimistic attitudes among psychiatrists toward the use of psilocybin in treating depression?,A higher level of knowledge about psilocybin.,"The abstract states that a higher level of knowledge about psilocybin correlates with more optimistic views regarding its therapeutic use, including for depression."

We also assessed the differences in these associations between women and men. We conducted a cross-sectional survey between July to October 2020 to adults who were living in Ecuador between March to October 2020. All data were collected through an online survey. We ran descriptive and bivariate analyses and fitted sex-stratified multivariate logistic regression models to assess the association between explanatory variables and self-reported health status. 1801 women and 1123 men completed the survey. Their median (IQR) age was 34 (27-44) years, most participants had a university education (84%) and a full-time public or private job (63%); 16% of participants had poor health self-perception. Poor self-perceived health was associated with being female, having solely public healthcare system access, perceiving housing conditions as inadequate, living with cohabitants requiring care, perceiving difficulties in coping with work or managing household chores, COVID-19 infection, chronic disease, and depression symptoms were significantly and independently associated with poor self-reported health status. For women, self-employment, having solely public healthcare system access, perceiving housing conditions as inadequate, having cohabitants requiring care, having very high difficulties to cope with household chores, having COVID-19, and having a chronic disease increased the likelihood of having poor self-reported health status. For men, poor or inadequate housing, presence of any chronic disease, and depression increased the likelihood of having poor self-reported health status.

37042546,The Major Depression Inventory for diagnosing according to DSM-5 and ICD-11: Psychometric properties and validity in a Swedish general population.,"The Major Depression Inventory (MDI) was constructed to assess DSM-IV and ICD-10 depression symptoms, and does not fully cover the symptoms listed in DSM-5 and ICD-11. This study aimed to augment the MDI to the new diagnostic standards by adding a new item, and to assess and compare the measurement performance of the MDI items and diagnostic algorithms for major depression according to DSM-IV, ICD-10, DSM-5 and ICD-11. Surveys collected 2001-2003 and 2021, including self-assessed MDI were used. A new hopelessness item was constructed and analyzed alongside the hopelessness item in the Symptom Checklist. The performance of items was compared using Rasch and Mokken analyses. Criterion validity was examined using equivalent diagnoses from psychiatric interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessments in Neuropsychiatry [SCAN]) as standard. MDI information was provided by 8511 individuals in 2001-2003 (SCAN subsample n = 878), and 8863 in 2021. All items, including hopelessness had good psychometric properties. Sensitivity ranged between 56% and 70%, and specificity between 95% and 96%, indicating similar criterion validity. Hopelessness and the MDI items had good psychometrics.

35670198,The moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the relationship between depression and stroke-specific quality of life in stroke dyads: a longitudinal study.,"To examine the moderating role of caregiver preparedness on the association between stroke survivors' depression and stroke-specific quality of life dimensions. We used a multilevel modelling approach to analyse trajectories of change in the eight Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 subscales [i.e. strength, communication, mobility, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), memory, emotion, hand function, participation] using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. Caregiver preparedness significantly moderated the association between survivor depressive symptoms and survivor communication (B = -0.95, P < 0.01), mobility (B = -0.60, P < 0.05), and ADL/IADL (B = -0.73, P < 0.01) at baseline; linear change for strength (B = 0.83, P < 0.05) and communication (B = 0.66, P < 0.05); and quadratic change for strength (B = -0.19, P < 0.01). Although caregiver preparedness did not significantly moderate the association between survivor depressive symptoms and strength at baseline, there was a significant moderating effect for change over time. Higher levels of caregiver preparedness were significantly associated with higher survivor scores of emotion, hand function, and participation at baseline. Including immediate caregivers in the care process, through a psycho-educational training, would mean having better-prepared caregivers and consequently more-healthy stroke survivors. Given that preparedness includes coping with stress, responding and managing emergencies, assessing help and information may require tailored interventions aimed at improving the caregivers' skills and knowledge about stroke survivors' management.",2023-Jan-12,European journal of cardiovascular nursing,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2023,YES,sa,How might caregiver preparedness influence the relationship between depressive symptoms and stroke survivors' ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) at baseline?,"Higher caregiver preparedness moderates the negative impact of depressive symptoms, leading to better ADL/IADL performance at baseline.","The abstract states that caregiver preparedness significantly moderates the association between survivor depressive symptoms and baseline ADL/IADL scores, suggesting better outcomes for survivors with well-prepared caregivers."
36648021,Directional associations between cannabis use and depression from late adolescence to young adulthood: the role of adverse childhood experiences.,"Although the co-occurrence of cannabis and depression is well established, less is known about the temporal sequence of cannabis use and depression. The present study had three main aims: to test a symptom-driven pathway in which depression may drive increases in cannabis use, to test a substance-induced pathway in which cannabis use may drive increases in depression and to assess a shared vulnerability model assessing associations between individuals who have (and have not) experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Data are from an ongoing, longitudinal, cohort study (n = 2234). Data were set up in an accelerated longitudinal design from age 17 to 24 years. Initial sample was recruited from Southern California, USA. The majority of participants still live in Southern California. On average, participants were aged 18 years at wave 8, with more than half identifying as female (54.3%; n = 1350). Most participants identified as Hispanic (1127; 45.4%), followed by non-Hispanic white (510; 20.5%), Asian (503; 20.2%), multi-racial/other (284; 11.4%) and non-Hispanic black (60; 2.2%). Primary outcomes were past-month days of cannabis use and depression symptoms [patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-8]. The Adverse Childhood Experiences scale was used as our main grouping measure. In the full sample, we showed that prior levels of depression symptoms were associated with a decrease in cannabis use [opposite to the proposed symptom driven model; B = -0.33 (-0.58, -0.09)]. Dynamic coupling parameters noted individuals who evidenced greater increases in cannabis use between two prior ages reported greater increases in depressive symptoms between subsequent ages [support for a substance-induced pathway; B = 0.53 (0.18, 0.89)]. Similar to the overall sample, for those who had not experienced ACEs, as cannabis use increased we saw a steady increase in depression [support for a substance induced pathway; B = 0.14 (0.04, 0.29)]. However, for those who experienced ACEs, as cannabis use increased we saw a consistent decrease in depression [opposite to the proposed substance-induced pathway; B = -0.18 (-0.28, -0.08)].

34368891,Prediction of clinical anxious and depressive problems in mid childhood amongst temperamentally inhibited preschool children: a population study.,"Shy/inhibited young children are at risk for internalising difficulties; however, for many, this temperamental style does not result in mental health problems. This study followed a population-based sample of temperamentally inhibited preschool children into mid childhood to explore the aetiology of clinical-level anxious and depressive problems. Amongst inhibited preschool children, we aimed to predict each of clinical child anxiety and depressive problems in mid childhood from a broad range of potential risks (demographics, traumatic events and broader recent stressors, parents' well-being, and parenting practices). This study is based on data from a wider population trial of Cool Little Kids that recruited a representative sample of inhibited preschool children enrolled in their year before starting school. In 2011-2012, an inhibition screen was universally distributed to parents of children in their year before school (age 4 years) across eight diverse government areas in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were 545 parents of inhibited preschoolers (78% uptake, 545/703) who were followed to mid childhood (three annual waves 2015-2017, age 7-10 years) with 84% retention (456/545). Parents completed questionnaires spanning child ages 4-10 years, along with diagnostic interviews for child anxiety. Children also completed questionnaires in mid childhood. The questionnaires encompassed a variety of potential risks including sociodemographics, traumatic events, recent life stressors, parent wellbeing and parenting practices. In mid childhood, 57% (246/430) of inhibited preschoolers had a clinical level of anxiety problems while 22% (95/432) had depressive problems (by one or more sources). The aetiology analyses highlighted parent distress and parenting practices (overinvolved/protective, harsh discipline) as key predictors of inhibited preschoolers' internalising problems by mid childhood. Some high-risk families may not have participated. Child depression was not assessed with a diagnostic interview. The measures did not include every possible risk factor. The findings lend support to parenting programs for shy/inhibited young children that aim to prevent the development of anxiety and depression as they grow.",2023-Feb,European child & adolescent psychiatry,Journal Article,2023,YES,sa,Which parenting practices are key predictors of clinical anxiety and depressive problems in temperamentally inhibited children as they grow into mid childhood?,Overinvolved/protective parenting and harsh discipline.,The abstract identifies overinvolved/protective parenting and harsh discipline as key predictors of clinical anxiety and depressive problems in inhibited preschoolers by mid childhood.

The pathogenesis of depression after ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. Here, we aim to determine whether GFAP concentrations were associated with post-stroke depression (PSD) at 3 months. From March 2022 to September 2022, patients with first-ever ischemic stroke were prospectively recruited. GFAP concentrations were detected within 24 h using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The PSD was defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24-Item score ≥ 8. A total of 206 subjects with ischemic stroke (mean age: 63.6 years; 49.0% female) were enrolled. During the 90-day follow-up, 57 participants (27.7%) were observed in PSD. The median serum GFAP concentrations were 0.67 ng/mL. After adjustment for the covariates, higher increased GFAP levels were associated with increased risk of PSD (odds ratio [OR], 7.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.29-15.44; <i>P</i> < 0.001). Also, the multivariate-adjusted OR of PSD associated with the fourth quartile of GFAP was 10.89 (95% CI, 3.53-33.60; <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared with the first quartile. Furthermore, the restricted cubic spline confirmed a linear association between GFAP and the risk of PSD (<i>P</i> for linearity < 0.001). Our results indicated that increased circulating GFAP concentrations were significantly correlated with the risk of PSD at 3 months.

34963320,Loneliness in Gender-Diverse and Sexual Orientation-Diverse Adolescents: Measurement Invariance Analyses and Between-Group Comparisons.,"Youth loneliness is a risk factor for myriad adverse psychosocial outcomes, making it a potentially informative construct for assessment and treatment research. Minority stressors may place LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) youths at high risk of loneliness. However, the prevalence of loneliness across gender and sexual identities cannot be precisely estimated or compared without establishing that common measures assess the construct equivalently across groups. In a preregistered study, we determined the optimal structure of the UCLA Loneliness Scale and investigated whether it showed invariance across gender and sexual identities in a national U.S. sample of adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms (<i>N</i> = 2,431; https://osf.io/52ctd). Results supported strict invariance, indicating that loneliness scores can be meaningfully compared across groups in this sample.

37256467,Kif15 deficiency contributes to depression-like behavior in mice.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders have a high incidence worldwide. Kinesins, a family of microtubule-based molecular motor proteins, play essential roles in intracellular and axonal transport. Variants of kinesins have been found to be related to many diseases, including neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorders. Kinesin-12 (also known as Kif15) was previously found to affect the frequency of both directional microtubule transports. However, whether Kif15 deficiency impacts mood in mice is yet to be investigated. In this study, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 method to obtain Kif15<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In behavioral tests, Kif15<sup>-/-</sup> female mice exhibited prominent depressive characteristics. Further studies showed that the expression of BDNF was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus of Kif15<sup>-/-</sup> mice, along with the upregulation of Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-1β in the corpus callosum. In addition, the expression patterns of AnkG were notably changed in the developing brain of Kif15<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Based on our previous studies, we suggested that this appearance of altered AnkG was due to the maladjustment of the microtubule patterns induced by Kif15 deficiency. The distribution of PSD95 in neurites notably decreased after cultured neurons treated with the Kif15 inhibitor, but total PSD95 protein level was not impacted, which revealed that Kif15 may contribute to PSD95 transportation. This study suggested that Kif15 may serve as a potential target for future depression studies.",2023-Oct,Metabolic brain disease,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2023,YES,sa,What molecular mechanism involving microtubule motor proteins might contribute to depressive characteristics via altered synaptic protein transport and inflammatory responses?,"Kif15 deficiency may impair PSD95 transport and increase Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-1β levels, contributing to depressive characteristics.","The abstract links Kif15 deficiency to reduced PSD95 distribution in neurites and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting impaired synaptic transport and inflammation as mechanisms for depression."

37600017,Chronic unpredictable mild stress alters odor hedonics and adult olfactory neurogenesis in mice.,"Experiencing chronic stress significantly increases the risk for depression. Depression is a complex disorder with varied symptoms across patients. However, feeling of sadness and decreased motivation, and diminished feeling of pleasure (anhedonia) appear to be core to most depressive pathology. Odorants are potent signals that serve a critical role in social interactions, avoiding danger, and consummatory behaviors. Diminished quality of olfactory function is associated with negative effects on quality of life leading to and aggravating the symptoms of depression. Odor hedonic value (I like or I dislike this smell) is a dominant feature of olfaction and guides approach or avoidance behavior of the odor source. The neural representation of the hedonic value of odorants is carried by the granule cells in the olfactory bulb, which functions to modulate the cortical relay of olfactory information. The granule cells of the olfactory bulb and those of the dentate gyrus are the two major populations of cells in the adult brain with continued neurogenesis into adulthood. In hippocampus, decreased neurogenesis has been linked to development or maintenance of depression symptoms. Here, we hypothesize that chronic mild stress can alter olfactory hedonics through effects on the olfactory bulb neurogenesis, contributing to the broader anhedonia phenotype in stress-associated depression. To test this, mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress and then tested on measures of depressive-like behaviors, odor hedonics, and measures of olfactory neurogenesis. Chronic unpredictable mild stress led to a selective effect on odor hedonics, diminishing attraction to pleasant but not unpleasant odorants, an effect that was accompanied by a specific decrease in adult neurogenesis and of the percentage of adult-born cells responding to pleasant odorants in the olfactory bulb.",2023,Frontiers in neuroscience,Journal Article,2023,YES,sa,How might chronic mild stress contribute to anhedonia in patients with depression through alterations in sensory processing?,"Chronic mild stress may reduce olfactory bulb neurogenesis, impairing hedonic processing of pleasant odorants and contributing to anhedonia.","The abstract links chronic mild stress to diminished attraction to pleasant odors via decreased olfactory bulb neurogenesis, paralleling broader anhedonia symptoms in depression."
38132358,Risk for Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) Linked to Circadian Clock Gene Variants.,"Molecular pathways affecting mood are associated with circadian clock gene variants and are influenced, in part, by the circadian clock, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this link are poorly understood. We use machine learning and statistical analyses to determine the circadian gene variants and clinical features most highly associated with symptoms of seasonality and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in a deeply phenotyped population sample. We report sex-specific clock gene effects on seasonality and SAD symptoms; genotypic combinations of CLOCK3111/ZBTB20 and PER2/PER3B were significant genetic risk factors for males, and CRY2/PER3C and CRY2/PER3-VNTR were significant risk factors for females. Anxiety, eveningness, and increasing age were significant clinical risk factors for seasonality and SAD for females. Protective factors for SAD symptoms (in females only) included single gene variants: CRY1-GG and PER3-VNTR-4,5. Clock gene effects were partially or fully mediated by diurnal preference or chronotype, suggesting multiple indirect effects of clock genes on seasonality symptoms. Interestingly, protective effects of CRY1-GG, PER3-VNTR-4,5, and ZBTB20 genotypes on seasonality and depression were not mediated by chronotype, suggesting some clock variants have direct effects on depressive symptoms related to SAD. Our results support previous links between CRY2, PER2, and ZBTB20 genes and identify novel links for CLOCK and PER3 with symptoms of seasonality and SAD. Our findings reinforce the sex-specific nature of circadian clock influences on seasonality and SAD and underscore the multiple pathways by which clock variants affect downstream mood pathways via direct and indirect mechanisms.",2023-Dec-15,Biology,Journal Article,2023,YES,sa,Which sex-specific clinical and genetic factors are protective against seasonal affective disorder symptoms?,"For females, CRY1-GG and PER3-VNTR-4,5 genotypes are protective against SAD symptoms.","The abstract identifies CRY1-GG and PER3-VNTR-4,5 as protective genetic factors for SAD symptoms in females, independent of chronotype, highlighting sex-specific direct effects of clock gene variants on mood regulation."

While individuals with CF commonly endure uncomfortable and/or distressing medical procedures, procedural anxiety among children and adolescents with CF has received little research attention. This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of procedural anxiety among individuals with CF aged 6-18 and their parents. Eighty-nine parents of children with CF completed surveys examining child procedural anxiety, anxiety, and health behaviors (including treatment adherence); and parent vicarious procedural anxiety. Seventy-five percent of participants rated at least one CF-related procedure as ""extremely"" anxiety-inducing for their child. Parental vicarious procedural anxiety was reported in 80.9% of participants. Procedural anxiety significantly correlated with child anxiety, treatment-resistive behaviors, and parent-vicarious procedural anxiety. Procedural anxiety was associated with younger age and frequency of distressing procedures, but not with forced expiratory volume in 1 s, body mass index, hospitalizations, or exposure to general anesthesia.

37153524,Increased inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress enhanced antibody production in breast and prostate cancer patients with COVID-19 related depression.,"Cancer management is highly dependent on the immune status of the patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of people suffered from anxiety and depression, especially cancer patients. The effect of depression on breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC) patients, during the pandemic has been analyzed in this study. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl content (CC) were estimated in patients' serum samples. Serum antibodies against <i>in vitro</i> hydroxyl radical (<sup>•</sup>OH) modified pDNA (<sup>•</sup>OH-pDNA-Abs) were estimated using direct binding and inhibition ELISA. Cancer patients showed increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers (MDA and CC levels), which were further significantly enhanced in cancer patients with depression compared to normal healthy (NH) individuals. Increased levels of <sup>•</sup>OH-pDNA-Abs were detected in breast cancer (0.506 ± 0.063) and prostate cancer (0.441 ± 0.066) patients compared to NH subjects. Serum antibodies were found to be significantly elevated in BC patients with depression (BCD) (0.698 ± 0.078) and prostate cancer patients with depression (PCD) (0.636 ± 0.058). Inhibition ELISA also exhibited significantly high percent inhibition in BCD (68.8% ± 7.8%) and PCD (62.9% ± 8.3%) subjects compared to BC (48.9% ± 8.1%), and PC (43.4% ± 7.5%) subjects. Cancer is characterized by enhanced oxidative stress and increased inflammation, which may be exaggerated with COVID-19 related depression.

37500950,Evaluating the Impact of the Prime Time Sister Circles<sup>®</sup> Intervention on Reducing Depressive Symptoms Among African American Women with Uncontrolled Hypertension.,"The Prime Time Sister Circles®, a randomized controlled trial (PTSC-RCT), assessed the impact of a community-based peer support program on hypertension management among African American women 40-75 years of age. While the PTSC-RCT was designed to evaluate changes in blood pressure control, subsequent sub-analyses revealed a high proportion of self-reported depressive symptoms in our sample. Accordingly, we conducted an ancillary investigation of the PTSC intervention on depression to ascertain its impact on reduced depressive symptoms in the study population. Depressive symptoms were measured using an adapted version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CES-D-10). We used unadjusted and adjusted fixed effect models. Data for this study came from the PTSC-RCT. We collected data between 2017 and 2018 in Washington, DC. We used a balanced analytical sample of 172 African American, English-speaking women between 40 to 75 years old with uncontrolled hypertension. The intervention group participated in a 2-h, peer-based support group once a week for 13 weeks. A trained PTSC facilitator facilitated sessions with experts who delivered content on various topics, including psychosocial wellness (e.g., stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety management, and self-esteem), physical health (e.g., hypertension, inflammation, and heart disease), physical activity, and healthy nutrition. Results from the fixed-effects models indicated that participants in the PTSC program exhibited a greater reduction in CES-D-10 score at three months (Coeff: -1.99, 95% CI: -3.49, -0.49) and at 15 months (Coeff: -2.38, 95% CI: -3.94, -0.83), as compared to those in the control group. Evidence suggests that the Prime Time Sister Circles® intervention reduced depressive symptoms among African American women with low socioeconomic status and hypertension.

36939885,Connexin 43 regulates astrocyte dysfunction and cognitive deficits in early life stress-treated mice.,"Early life stress such as maternal separation (MS), is a major risk factor for developing psychiatric disorders in adulthood. Connexin 43 (CX43), the main type of connexins expressed in astrocytes, has been indicated to participate in depression disorders. Nevertheless, the role of CX43 in MS-induced cognitive impairment and astrocyte dysfunction is unclear. Neonatal C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MS to mimic early life stress. Adeno-associated virus carrying CX43 was inoculated into mice for CX43 overexpression. Sucrose preference test, forced swim test and Morris water maze were performed for evaluating depression-like behaviors and spatial learning and memory of mice in adulthood. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to detect CX43 mRNA expression in mouse brain. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used for measuring expression levels of astrocytic markers in murine hippocampal dentate gyrus. The results showed that overexpressing CX43 attenuated MS exposure-induced depression-like behaviors and decrease in spatial learning and memory in mice. Upregulating CX43 alleviated MS exposure-induced downregulation of astrocytic markers.

38017662,"Gut feelings: the relations between depression, anxiety, psychotropic drugs and the gut microbiome.","The gut microbiome is involved in the bi-directional relationship of the gut - brain axis. As most studies of this relationship are small and do not account for use of psychotropic drugs (PTDs), we explored the relations of the gut microbiome with several internalizing disorders, while adjusting for PTDs and other relevant medications, in 7,656 Lifelines participants from the Northern Netherlands (5,522 controls and 491 participants with at least one internalizing disorder). Disorders included dysthymia, major depressive disorder (MDD), any depressive disorder (AnyDep: dysthymia or MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and any anxiety disorder (AnyAnx: GAD, social phobia and panic disorder). Compared to controls, 17 species were associated with depressive disorders and 3 were associated with anxiety disorders. Around 90% of these associations remained significant (FDR <0.05) after adjustment for PTD use, suggesting that the disorders, not PTD use, drove these associations. Negative associations were observed for the butyrate-producing bacteria <i>Ruminococcus bromii</i> in participants with AnyDep and for <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i> in AnyAnx participants, along with many others. Tryptophan and glutamate synthesis modules and the 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid synthesis module (related to dopamine metabolism) were negatively associated with MDD and/or dysthymia. After additional adjustment for functional gastrointestinal disorders and irritable bowel syndrome, these relations remained either statistically (FDR <0.05) or nominally (<i>P</i> < 0.05) significant. Overall, multiple bacterial species and functional modules were associated with internalizing disorders, including gut - brain relevant components, while associations to PTD use were moderate.

36716565,Parental depressive symptoms across the first three years of a child's life and emotional and behavioural problem trajectories in children and adolescents.,"The risk associated with parental perinatal depressive symptoms and the continuum of emotional and behavioural problems in offspring is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between maternal and paternal perinatal depressive symptoms and behavioural problem trajectories in offspring aged 3-16 years. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in Bristol, Avon, United Kingdom (UK). Parental perinatal depressive symptoms in the first three years of a child's life were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Offspring emotional- and behavioural problems were measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when the child was 3.5, 7, 9, 11, and 16 years. A group-based trajectory modelling was used to identify the distinct trajectories of emotional and behavioural problems. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations, and z-scores were calculated to compare maternal and paternal associations. We identified three trajectories of emotional and behavioural problems in offspring between the ages of 3.5 and 16: low, moderate and high symptom trajectories. We found that maternal and paternal antenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms were associated with high levels of emotional and behavioural problem trajectories in offspring. We also found that children exposed to maternal (<sub>adjusted</sub> RR = 8.11; 95% CI: 5.26-12.48) and paternal (<sub>adjusted</sub> RR = 2.32; 1.05-5.14) persistent depressive symptoms were more likely to be in high levels of total behavioural problem trajectory group than in the normal trajectory group.

37802623,Facilitators of and barriers to perinatal telepsychiatry care: a qualitative study.,"Perinatal mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression and bipolar disorder can negatively impact the health of women and their children without appropriate detection and treatment. Due to increases in mental health symptoms and transmission risks associated with in-person appointments, many clinics transitioned to providing telepsychiatry care during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to identify the facilitators and barriers to receiving perinatal telepsychiatry care from the perspective of patients, clinic staff and psychiatrists. Qualitative study based on analysis of in depth semistructured interviews. The study was conducted in a virtual specialty mental health clinic in an academic setting. Eight patients who had been scheduled for an appointment with the perinatal telepsychiatry clinic between 14 May 2021 and 1 August 2021, seven of whom had attended their scheduled appointment with the clinic and one of whom had not, and five staff members including psychiatrists, navigators and clinic managers, participated in in-depth interviews. Telepsychiatry was perceived by most as preferable to in-person care and easy to attend and navigate. Alternatively, technological difficulties, personal preference for in-person care and scheduling conflicts related to the perinatal period were identified as barriers by some. Participants identified communication between care staff and patients, online patient portals, and appointment reminders as important for facilitating appointment preparedness and attendance. The findings from this study suggest that telepsychiatry services are perceived positively by patients and care staff and have the potential to improve access to mental healthcare for perinatal patients.",2023-Oct-06,BMJ open,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2023,YES,sa,What are two potential barriers to accessing telepsychiatry services for perinatal patients with clinical depression or anxiety disorders?,Technological difficulties and personal preference for in-person care.,"The abstract identifies technological difficulties and personal preference for in-person care as barriers to telepsychiatry access for perinatal patients, which could hinder timely detection and treatment of clinical depression or anxiety disorders in this population."
33882587,Reproducibility of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during the Postpartum Period.,"This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in the immediate postpartum period, which we defined as between 3 and 24 hours postpartum for the purpose of this research. This is such that if it can predict scores obtained at the postpartum visit, it will be an opportunity to access psychiatric services for the patient that may otherwise be more difficult to access in the outpatient setting. Longitudinal observational study, which included an analysis of 848 consecutive participants screened with the EPDS in the hospital and at the 6-week postpartum visit. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggested >3 at delivery as a more optimal score to predict depression at the postpartum visit with sensitivity 76.5% and specificity 65.9%. The commonly accepted EPDS cut-off value of >9 was far less sensitive at 28.8% but reasonably specific at 93.2% for predicting elevated scores (>9) 6 weeks postpartum. In subgroup analysis, only a prior mental health disorder was found to be predictive of elevated scores at the postpartum visit (relative risk: 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-3.32, <i>p</i> = 0.01). The EPDS, originally designed to screen for postpartum depression (PPD) in the outpatient setting, does not predict the development of PPD, as determined by the EPDS (validated at the 6-week postpartum time interval) when administered during hospitalization shortly after delivery. · EPDS is a validated screening tool for PPD that is validated in the outpatient setting, but various guidelines are presently unclear on the exact timing for PPD screening.. · EPDS scores from 3 to 24 hours postpartum does not reliably predict elevated scores 6 weeks later.. · EPDS scores >3 from 3 to 24 hours postpartum may identify need to ""rule out"" PPD 6 weeks later..",2023-Jan,American journal of perinatology,Observational Study; Journal Article,2023,YES,sa,What is the optimal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) cut-off score for predicting postpartum depression at 6 weeks when administered between 3 and 24 hours postpartum?,The optimal EPDS cut-off score is >3.,"The abstract states that an EPDS score >3 shortly postpartum has a sensitivity of 76.5% and specificity of 65.9% for predicting elevated scores at the 6-week postpartum visit, making it the more optimal threshold."

However, it is not clear how these depressive symptoms are interconnected, or if some symptoms are more influential in affecting QoL. In the Cohort of Patients with Parkinson's Disease in Spain (COPPADIS) study, 686 patients with PD were analyzed using network analyses. The patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) and provided their overall QoL (EUROHIS-QOL) at the beginning of the study. The study used centrality measures such as Expected Influence and Bridge Expected Influence to identify depressive symptoms that had the greatest impact on overall QoL. The results of exploratory network analyses indicate that the BDI-II items related to <i>loss of energy</i>, <i>past failure</i>, and <i>tiredness or fatigue</i> have the greatest impact on overall QoL as measured by the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index.

37990619,Heart rate variability: Evaluating a potential biomarker of anxiety disorders.,"Establishing quantifiable biological markers associated with anxiety will increase the objectivity of phenotyping and enhance genetic research of anxiety disorders. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological measure reflecting the dynamic relationship between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and is a promising target for further investigation. This review summarizes evidence evaluating HRV as a potential physiological biomarker of anxiety disorders by highlighting literature related to anxiety and HRV combined with investigations of endophenotypes, neuroimaging, treatment response, and genetics. Deficient HRV shows promise as an endophenotype of pathological anxiety and may serve as a noninvasive index of prefrontal cortical control over the amygdala, and potentially aid with treatment outcome prediction. We propose that the genetics of HRV can be used to enhance the understanding of the genetics of pathological anxiety for etiological investigations and treatment prediction. Given the anxiety-HRV link, strategies are offered to advance genetic analytical approaches, including the use of polygenic methods, wearable devices, and pharmacogenetic study designs.

36973356,"The shattered ""Iron Rice Bowl"": effects of Chinese state-owned enterprise reform on depressive symptoms in later life.","The SOE reform was the first time that economic insecurity was introduced since 1949 in China, with hundreds of million employees affected by the laid off. This study took the State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) reform in China as a natural experiment to explore the impact of economic insecurity on depressive symptoms in later life. Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS), 2014 and 2015. CHARLS is a nationally representative survey covering 28 provinces in China. CHARLS used the probabilities proportional to size (PPS) sampling method and involved 450 villages/resident committees, 150 counties/districts and 12,400 households. A total of 5113 urban dwellers born earlier than 1971 (aged 25 years old and above at the start of the SOE reform, 1995) were involved. Using the province-level  economic loss from the layoffs, we examined the impact of economic insecurity exposure on the score of depressive symptoms using a difference-in-differences model (DID). Individuals with economic insecurity exposure had a significantly increased risk of higher depressive symptoms scores, in which a 1 percentage point increase in expected economic loss would increase the CESD-10 score by 0.10. For an individual at the median distribution (CESD-10 = 5), this implies a shift to the 58th percentile (CESD-10 = 6). Given that the average intensity of expected economic loss is 10.22% and the mean CESD-10 is 6.92, exposure to the SOE reform led to an average increase in the CESD-10 score by 1.02 and by at least 14.74%. The heterogeneity analyses showed that the role of SOE reform in depressive symptoms scores was robust in both female and male groups and groups with different educational attainment. Economic insecurity exposure increased the depressive symptoms score later in life in the context of China. Programs, such as adequate unemployment insurance benefits, can protect individuals against the risk of financial loss, thereby reducing their negative impact on depressive symptoms. Providing mental symptoms surveillance and psychological counseling to those experienced at a time of great uncertainty is important for preventing depression in times of economic insecurity.",2023-Aug,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Journal Article; Multicenter Study,2023,YES,sa,"How might exposure to economic insecurity during mid-life affect depressive symptoms in later life, and what interventions could mitigate this impact?",Economic insecurity exposure in mid-life increases depressive symptoms in later life.

36642102,Baicalin attenuates chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis through regulating SIRT1/PARP1 signaling pathway.,"Baicalin (BA), a flavonoid glycoside extracts from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported to exert antidepressant effects. Emerging evidence indicates that neuronal apoptosis plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) is established as a key regulator of the cellular apoptosis. In the present study, we explored whether BA exerts antidepressant effects by regulating PARP1 signaling pathway and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. We found that administration of BA (30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg) alleviated chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like behaviors by increasing sucrose consumption in sucrose preference test (SPT), improving activity status in open field test (OFT) and reducing rest time in tail suspension test (TST). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining showed that BA ameliorated CUMS-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Moreover, BA significantly upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, downregulated pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 after CUMS in hippocampal of mice. Intriguingly, western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) results showed that the protein level of PARP1 was significantly increased in hippocampal tissue after CUMS, which was reversed by BA treatment. In primary hippocampal neurons (PHNs), BA abrogated the neuronal apoptosis caused by PARP1 overexpression. Meanwhile, BA significantly increased the protein level of SIRT1, SIRT1 inhibitor (EX-527) treatment reversed the effect of BA on reducing the protein level of PARP1 and neuronal apoptosis in CUMS-induced mice.

The antidepressant effects of Rg1 have been validated; however, the specific underlying mechanism of this effect needs further research. Rats were subjected to the chronic restraint stress (CRS) depression model. Rg1, or a positive control drug, was administered to the rats. Depression-like behaviours were evaluated through behavioural experiments. Cytokine, mRNA, protein, ATP, and mitochondria DNA levels were detected using the indicated methods. Lentivirus-packaged plasmids were injected into the rat brain for GAS5 overexpression or knockdown. In vitro mitochondrial dysfunction was evaluated by detecting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential. Direct interaction between GAS5 and EZH2 was validated by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assay. The enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 was evaluated through chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative real-time PCR. Rg1 treatment alleviated depression-like behaviours, microglial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in CRS rats. Similarly, GAS5 knockdown revealed a similar protective effect of Rg1 treatment.

Cross-sectionally, family hardiness has been found to have a moderating effect on the relationship between stressors and mental health severity. Recent advances in family resilience theory highlight the importance of considering trajectories of family resilience. Trajectories of family hardiness and their moderating effect on the relationship between trajectories of perceived economic hardship and symptoms of depression and anxiety in low-income mothers and children were investigated in 511 mother-child dyads in Singapore. Three trajectories of family hardiness were delineated, namely the high stable, low rapidly increasing and moderate increasing group. The trajectories of family hardiness were found to moderate the relationship between trajectories of perceived economic hardship and symptoms of mental health in low-income mothers and children. The same moderation effect was not found when perceived economic hardship and family hardiness were investigated cross-sectionally.

34983334,Longitudinal Study of Depression on Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and Financial Capacity.,"Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) among other cognitive deficits also includes impairments in financial capacity, but so far the role of depression in time has not been examined. We aimed to examine the hypothesis that individuals with aMCI and comorbid worsening depression levels would demonstrate greater deficits in financial capacity atone year in relation to multiple-domain aMCI patients with stable levels of depression, aMCI patients without depression and healthy individuals. Ninety-six Greek women and 24 men aged 54 and older (multiple-domain aMCI with, stable and increased levels of depression at one year, aMCI without depressive symptoms, and cognitively intact elders with and without depression) were examined with the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and the Legal Capacity for Property Law Transactions Assessment Scale (LCPLTAS). Bootstrapped ANCOVA was implemented. Multiple-domain aMCI patients' performance regarding financial capacity is severely impaired when depression co-exists, resembling the performance of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease, and it declines further when depression deteriorates. Findings contribute to the limited evidence in financial capacity assessment when depression co-exists showing that higher depressive symptom scores are associated with reduced financial capacity scores and deterioration of depressive symptomatology worsens not only general cognitive outcome, but financial capacity in particular. Proactive care for individuals with depression is needed as this condition severely influences financial capacity in aMCI.",2022,Clinical gerontologist,Journal Article,2022,YES,sa,How does worsening depressive symptomatology affect financial capacity in patients with multiple-domain amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)?,"Worsening depressive symptomatology in multiple-domain aMCI patients leads to further deterioration in financial capacity, resembling deficits seen in mild Alzheimer's disease.","The abstract indicates that higher depressive symptoms correlate with reduced financial capacity, and worsening depression exacerbates financial deficits, highlighting the compounding impact of depression on cognitive and financial abilities in aMCI."
36162077,Anterior Insula Activation During Cardiac Interoception Relates to Depressive Symptom Severity in HIV-Positive and HIV-Negative Postmenopausal Women.,"This study aimed to determine whether subclinical symptoms of depression in postmenopausal women are associated with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity within the anterior insula during cardiac interoceptive awareness and whether this association differs for persons living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PWH). Twenty-three postmenopausal (mean [standard deviation] age = 56.5 [4.8] years) and 27 HIV-negative women (mean [standard deviation] age = 56.4 [8.0]) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a heartbeat detection task. BOLD activation within the bilateral anterior insula based on the contrast of a heartbeat detection condition with and without a distracting tone was entered along with age, HIV status, and psychological stress into two multivariate regression models with self-reported depressive symptom severity as the outcome. Depressive symptoms did not vary by HIV status, nor was there a main effect or interaction for PWH on insula BOLD activation. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with psychological stress for the left ( β = 0.310, t (49) = 2.352, p = .023) and right brain models ( β = 0.296, t (49) = 2.265, p = .028) as well as the magnitude of BOLD activation in the left insula ( β = 0.290, t (49) = 2.218, p = .032) and right insula ( β = 0.318, t (49) = 2.453, p = .018), respectively. Exploratory analyses revealed that greater magnitude of BOLD activation attributed to exteroceptive noise (tone) was also correlated with self-reported distrust and preoccupation with interoceptive sensations. Results support an active interference model for interoceptive awareness wherein greater BOLD signal in the anterior insula in the presence of distracting exteroceptive stimuli may reflect greater prediction error, a feature of depression.",2022-Oct-01,Psychosomatic medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,YES,sa,How might increased anterior insula activation during interoceptive tasks with external distractions relate to depressive symptom severity?,"Increased anterior insula activation may reflect greater prediction error during interoceptive tasks, which is associated with higher depressive symptom severity.","The abstract links greater anterior insula BOLD activation during tasks with distracting stimuli to depressive symptoms, suggesting an active interference model where prediction error contributes to depression's pathophysiology."
36549378,Computational models of subjective feelings in psychiatry.,"Research in computational psychiatry is dominated by models of behavior. Subjective experience during behavioral tasks is not well understood, even though it should be relevant to understanding the symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Here, we bridge this gap and review recent progress in computational models for subjective feelings. For example, happiness reflects not how well people are doing, but whether they are doing better than expected. This dependence on recent reward prediction errors is intact in major depression, although depressive symptoms lower happiness during tasks. Uncertainty predicts subjective feelings of stress in volatile environments. Social prediction errors influence feelings of self-worth more in individuals with low self-esteem despite a reduced willingness to change beliefs due to social feedback. Measuring affective state during behavioral tasks provides a tool for understanding psychiatric symptoms that can be dissociable from behavior. When smartphone tasks are collected longitudinally, subjective feelings provide a potential means to bridge the gap between lab-based behavioral tasks and real-life behavior, emotion, and psychiatric symptoms.",2023-Feb,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,"Journal Article; Review; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2022,YES,sa,How does the relationship between reward prediction errors and happiness differ in individuals with major depression during behavioral tasks?,"Reward prediction errors influence happiness similarly in major depression, but depressive symptoms lower overall happiness levels during tasks.","The abstract states that happiness depends on recent reward prediction errors, and this relationship remains intact in major depression.

35674931,Valproic Acid-Induced Anxiety and Depression Behaviors are Ameliorated in p39 Cdk5 Activator-Deficient Mice.,"Valproic acid (VPA) is a drug used for the treatment of epilepsy, seizures, migraines, and bipolar disorders. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a Ser/Thr kinase activated by p35 or p39 in neurons and plays a role in a variety of neuronal functions, including psychiatric behaviors. We previously reported that VPA suppressed Cdk5 activity by reducing the expression of p35 in cultured cortical neurons, leaving p39 unchanged. In this study, we asked for the role of Cdk5 in VPA-induced anxiety and depression behaviors. Wild-type (WT) mice displayed increased anxiety and depression after chronic administration of VPA for 14 days, when the expression of p35 was decreased. To clarify their relationship, we used p39 knockout (KO) mice, in which p35 is the only Cdk5 activator. When p39 KO mice were treated chronically with VPA, unexpectedly, they exhibited fewer anxiety and depression behaviors than WT mice. The effects were p39 cdk5r2 gene-dosage dependent. Together, these results indicate that Cdk5-p39 plays a specific role in VPA-induced anxiety and depression behaviors.",2022-Sep,Neurochemical research,Journal Article,2022,YES,sa,How might the gene-dosage of p39 influence the severity of anxiety and depression behaviors in mice treated chronically with valproic acid?,Reduced p39 gene-dosage is associated with fewer anxiety and depression behaviors in mice treated with valproic acid.,"The abstract states that p39 knockout mice exhibited fewer anxiety and depression behaviors than wild-type mice after chronic valproic acid treatment, and these effects were p39 gene-dosage dependent."
36561855,"Cross-lagged relationship between anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance among college students during and after collective isolation.","Repeated quarantine policies over the past 3 years have led to poor psychological consequences for the public. Previous studies have proved that the quarantine policy leaves individuals vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and insomnia, especially among college students. This study aims to explore whether psychological problems during isolation continue with the release of isolation. Overall, 2,787 college students both answered a web-based survey during and after the closure management was lifted. The Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and Youth Self-rating Insomnia Scale were measured. The cross-lagged path model was used to explore the influence of psychological impact during isolation on the individual after the release. We found that anxiety and sleep disturbance levels alleviated significantly after quarantine, except for depression. As expected, a bidirectional relationship exists between anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Moreover, depression and sleep disturbance can predict post quarantine depression, sleep disturbance, and anxiety, yet anxiety cannot predict sleep disturbance afterward.

34995725,HINT1 deficiency in aged mice reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and enhances cognitive performances.,"Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) is regarded as a haplo-insufficient tumour suppressor and is closely associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorders. In addition, HINT1 knockout (KO) mice exhibit anxiolytic-like behaviour, antidepression-like behaviour, and enhanced cognitive performance in several studies. However, it is still unclear whether aging contributes to these changes in the emotion and cognition of HINT1 KO mice. This study examined the role of aging in anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and cognition behaviours in aged HINT1 KO mice compared with young HINT1 KO mice and their wild-type littermates, along with a number of molecular biological methods. In a battery of behavioural tests, aged wild-type mice showed increased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and decreased cognitive performance, along with lower expression levels of glutathione peroxidase, enhanced amount of malondialdehyde, and decreased expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine kinase B in the hippocampus and PFC compared to young wild-type mice. HINT1 KO mice showed reduced anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and enhanced cognitive performance compared to age-matched wild-type mice. In addition, HINT1 KO mice also showed increased GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase, and decreased malondialdehyde, together with enhanced BDNF and Trk-B expression in the hippocampus and PFC. However, when compared with young HINT1 KO mice, aged HINT1 KO mice did not show increased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours. And there are no differences in the expression level of superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, BDNF, and Trk-B between aged and young HINT1 KO mice. In summary, HINT1 deficiency can counteract age-related emotion and cognition dysfunction.",2022-Mar,Experimental gerontology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2022,YES,sa,How might HINT1 deficiency influence age-related emotional and cognitive dysfunction in clinical depression or anxiety disorders?,HINT1 deficiency may reduce age-related anxiety and depression-like behaviors and enhance cognitive performance by increasing antioxidant enzymes and neurotrophic factors in the hippocampus and PFC.,"The abstract shows HINT1 KO mice counteract age-related emotional and cognitive dysfunction via increased GSH-Px, SOD, BDNF, and Trk-B, suggesting therapeutic potential in depression and anxiety disorders."
35490841,Development of Proactive Control and Anxiety Among Behaviorally Inhibited Adolescents.,"Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an infant temperament characterized by heightened reactivity and negative affect in response to novel people and situations. BI is among the earliest and strongest predictors of future anxiety problems. However, not all children with a history of BI will manifest anxiety problems. A growing body of evidence suggests that proactive control skills may help buffer youth with BI from future anxiety difficulties; yet, it remains unclear how temperament may interact with the development of cognitive control to influence anxiety risk. The present study tested whether enhancements in proactive control occurring during adolescence may reduce risk for anxiety among youth with a history of BI. Participants included 185 adolescents (56% female) whose temperament was assessed during toddlerhood. In adolescence, participants completed anxiety assessments and an AX Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) to assess cognitive control strategy. Both assessments were administered at age 13 years and again at 15 years. Latent change score modeling revealed that, on average, participants increasingly used proactive control strategies and experienced worsening anxiety from age 13-15 years. Early BI was associated with a smaller anxiety increase from 13-15 years, but only among participants whose proactive control skills improved at mean or greater rates. The present findings suggest that greater proactive control development during adolescence protects youth with high BI from age-related increases in anxiety. Results support a framework that highlights cognitive control as a key moderator of anxiety risk among children with a history of high BI.",2022-Dec,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",2022,YES,sa,How might improvements in proactive cognitive control during adolescence influence anxiety trajectories in individuals with early behavioral inhibition?,Improved proactive control during adolescence may mitigate age-related increases in anxiety for individuals with early behavioral inhibition.,The abstract states that greater proactive control development during adolescence protects youth with high behavioral inhibition from worsening anxiety between ages 13-15.
35150151,The prevalence of mental health conditions in healthcare workers during and after a pandemic: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This review aims to explore the prevalence and incidence rates of mental health conditions in healthcare workers during and after a pandemic outbreak and which factors influence rates. Pandemics place considerable burden on care services, impacting on workers' health and their ability to deliver services. We systematically reviewed the prevalence and incidence of mental health conditions in care workers during pandemics. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and PsychINFO for cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies were undertaken on the 31 March 2020 (from inception to 31 March 2020). Only prevalence or incidence rates for mental health conditions from validated tools were included. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by two reviewers. Meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were produced for pandemic period (pre- and post), age, country income, country, clinical setting for major depression disorder (MDD), anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). No studies of incidence were found. Prevalence estimates showed that the most common mental health condition was PTSD (21.7%) followed by anxiety disorder (16.1%), MDD (13.4%) and acute stress disorder (7.4%) (low risk of bias). For symptoms of these conditions there was substantial variation in the prevalence estimates for depression (95% confidence interval [CI]:31.8%; 60.5%), anxiety (95% CI:34.2%; 57.7%) and PTSD symptoms (95% CI,21.4%; 65.4%) (moderate risk of bias). Age, level of exposure and type of care professional were identified as important moderating factors. Mental disorders affect healthcare workers during and after infectious disease pandemics, with higher proportions experiencing symptoms.

35020758,The mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey in the UK.,"Higher education students' mental health has been a growing concern in recent years even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The stresses and restrictions associated with the pandemic have put university students at greater risk of developing mental health issues, which may significantly impair their academic success, social interactions and their future career and personal opportunities. This paper aimed to understand the mental health status of University students at an early stage in the pandemic and to investigate factors associated with higher levels of distress. An online survey including demographics, lifestyle/living situations, brief mental well-being history, questions relating to COVID-19 and standardised measures of depression, anxiety, resilience and quality of life was completed by 1173 students at one University in the North of England. We found high levels of anxiety and depression, with more than 50% experiencing levels above the clinical cut offs, and females scoring significantly higher than males. The survey also suggested relatively low levels of resilience which we attribute to restrictions and isolation which reduced the opportunities to engage in helpful coping strategies and activities rather than enduring personality characteristics. Higher levels of distress were associated with lower levels of exercising, higher levels of tobacco use, and a number of life events associated with the pandemic and lockdown, such as cancelled events, worsening in personal relationships and financial concerns. We discuss the importance of longer-term monitoring and mental health support for university students.",2022,PloS one,Journal Article,2022,YES,sa,What lifestyle factors are associated with higher levels of clinical anxiety and depression in university students during a pandemic?,"Lower levels of exercise, higher levels of tobacco use, and pandemic-related life events like canceled events, worsening relationships, and financial concerns.","The abstract identifies these lifestyle factors and pandemic-related stressors as contributors to increased distress, including clinical anxiety and depression, among university students."
35044637,β-Blockers and the Risk of Depression: A Matched Case-Control Study.,"Depression is a commonly cited adverse effect of β-blockers but the evidence for a causal relationship is limited. We aimed to explore whether β-blockers are associated with an increased risk of new-onset depression. We conducted a case-control study using the UK population-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD. We identified patients aged 18-80 years with an incident depression diagnosis between 2000 and 2016, and matched controls, and estimated the risk (odds ratio [OR]) of depression in association with use of β-blockers. We also conducted analyses of exposure, categorised by number and timing of prescriptions and by indication for β-blocker use. The study encompassed 118,705 patients with incident depression and the same number of matched controls. The odds of developing depression were increased for current short-term use of any β-blocker (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72-2.12), whereas current long-term use was not associated with the risk of depression compared with never use. The elevated risk of depression among short-term users was mostly confined to propranolol users with a neuropsychiatric disorder (aOR 6.33, 95% CI 5.16-7.76), while propranolol users with a cardiovascular indication were only at marginally increased risk of depression (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.14-1.82). This study suggests that the association between use of β-blockers and depression may not be causal but rather a result of protopathic bias. Propranolol is often prescribed to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggesting that the onset of depression may be related to the underlying indication rather than to an effect of a β-blocker therapy.",2022-Feb,Drug safety,Journal Article,2022,YES,sa,What is a plausible explanation for the elevated risk of depression among short-term propranolol users prescribed the drug for neuropsychiatric indications?,"Protopathic bias, where depression onset is linked to the underlying neuropsychiatric condition rather than propranolol itself.","The abstract suggests propranolol is often prescribed for neuropsychiatric symptoms, implying the depression risk may stem from the underlying condition rather than the β-blocker therapy."
35358744,Frontolimbic Network Topology Associated With Risk and Presence of Depression in Adolescents: A Study Using a Composite Risk Score in Brazil.,"There have been significant challenges in understanding functional brain connectivity associated with adolescent depression, including the need for a more comprehensive approach to defining risk, the lack of representation of participants from low- and middle-income countries, and the need for network-based approaches to model connectivity. The current study aimed to address these challenges by examining resting-state functional connectivity of frontolimbic circuitry associated with the risk and presence of depression in adolescents in Brazil. Adolescents in Brazil ages 14 to 16 years were classified into low-risk, high-risk, and depressed groups using a clinical assessment and composite risk score that integrates 11 sociodemographic risk variables. After excluding participants with excessive head movement, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 126 adolescents were analyzed. We compared group differences in frontolimbic network connectivity using region of interest-to-region of interest, graph theory, and seed-based connectivity analyses. Associations between self-reported depressive symptoms and brain connectivity were also explored. Adolescents with depression showed greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex compared with the 2 risk groups and greater dorsal ACC global efficiency than the low-risk group. Adolescents with depression also showed reduced local efficiency and a lower clustering coefficient of the subgenual ACC compared with the 2 risk groups. The high-risk group also showed a lower subgenual ACC clustering coefficient relative to the low-risk group. These findings highlight altered connectivity and topology of the ACC within frontolimbic circuitry as potential neural correlates and risk factors of developing depression in adolescents in Brazil.

35286526,Mechanisms of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Post-stroke Depression: A Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study.,"We aimed to identify neural mechanisms underlying clinical response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in post-stroke depression (PSD) by the Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Thirty-two depressed patients after ischemic stroke were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 20 min of 5 Hz rTMS or sham over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in addition to routine supportive treatments. The clinical outcome was measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), while the imaging results were acquired from rs-fMRI, including regional homogeneity (ReHo), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) and seed-based dynamic functional connection (dFC). HRSD-17 scores were improved in the two groups after treatment (P < 0.01), while greater mood improvement was observed in the rTMS group (P < 0.05). Compared with the sham group, the rTMS group demonstrated regions with higher ReHo and fALFF values locating mainly in the left hemisphere and highly consistent with the default mode network (DMN) (p < 0.05). Using the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as seeds, significant difference between the two groups in dFC within the DMN was found after treatment, including 10 connections with increased connectivity strength and 2 connections with reduced connectivity strength. The ReHo, fALFF and dFC values within DMN in the rTMS group were negatively correlated with the HDRS scores after treatment (P < 0.05).

Whereas many studies address the effects of long-term social isolation in post-weaning and adolescence and for periods ranging from 4 to 12 weeks, little is known about the repercussions of adult long-term social isolation in middle age. Thus, our aim was to investigate how long-term social isolation can influence metabolic, behavioural, and central nervous system-related areas in middle-aged mice. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice (4 months-old) were randomly divided into Social (2 cages, n = 5/cage) and Isolated (10 cages, n = 1/cage) housing groups, totalizing 30 weeks of social isolation, which ended concomitantly with the onset of middle age of mice. At the end of the trial, metabolic parameters, short-term memory, anxiety-like behaviour, and physical activity were assessed. Immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus (ΔFosB, BDNF, and 8OHDG) and hypothalamus (ΔFosB) was also performed. The Isolated group showed impaired memory along with a decrease in hippocampal ΔFosB at dentate gyrus and in BDNF at CA3. Food intake was also affected, but the direction depended on how it was measured in the Social group (individually or in the group) with no alteration in ΔFosB at the hypothalamus. Physical activity parameters increased with chronic isolation, but in the light cycle (inactive phase), with some evidence of anxiety-like behaviour. Future studies should better explore the timepoint at which the alterations found begin.

35367456,Gender differences in short- vs. long-term impact of maternal depression following pre-gestational chronic mild stress.,"Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with Peripartum Onset was classified in 2013 by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DMS-5) and approved in 2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO). These diagnostic revisions call for the development of new animal models of maternal depression, emphasizing the pregnancy period. We have recently described a novel rat model of maternal MDD with a Peripartum Onset. Exposure to pre-gestational chronic mild stress (CMS) with repeated restrain resulted in maternal depressive-like behavior and impacted offspring's neurodevelopment. The present study examined gender differences in short- vs. long-term neurodevelopmental impact of pre-gestational maternal stress. Stress response was assessed in Sprague Dawley CMS-exposed dams (n=7) by metabolic, hormonal, and behavioral changes and compared to controls dams (n=7). Short-term impact of maternal stress on offspring was examined in terms of metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and behavioral tests in male (n=40) and female (n=35) adolescent offspring on a postnatal day (PD) 48; the long-term impact was assessed in adult male (n=13) and female (n=12) offspring on PD 225. Brain tissue was collected from adolescent and adult offspring for biochemical analysis. Maternal stress was associated with decreased body weight and increased urinary corticosterone during the pre-pregnancy period, but depressive-like behavior was delayed until later in pregnancy. No significant neurodevelopmental changes in suckling male or female offspring derived from the stress-exposed dams were observed. However, adolescent male and female offspring of stress-exposed dams displayed an increased depressive-like behavior and gender-dependent increase in anxiety-like behavior in female offspring. These changes were associated with a brain-region-specific increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein and BDNF receptor (TrkB) mRNA in males. Behavioral changes observed in the adolescents receded in adult male and female offspring. However, plasma BDNF was elevated in stress-exposed adult female offspring. These results suggest that pre-gestational maternal stress is associated with gender-dependent short- vs. long-term neurodevelopmental impact in the offspring. Presented data are of significant public health relevance, and there is an urgent need for further research to confirm these findings and probe the underlying mechanisms.",2022-Jul,Experimental neurology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2022,YES,sa,"How might pre-gestational chronic mild stress in mothers impact depressive-like behavior and anxiety in adolescent offspring, and how does this differ by gender?","Adolescent offspring show increased depressive-like behavior in both genders, with gender-dependent anxiety increases in females.

35932599,Self-efficacy mediates the associations of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms with type 2 diabetes management and glycemic control.,"Adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) often experience two common diabetes-related psychological distress: diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. Both are associated with adverse diabetes outcomes including poor self-management and glycemic control. However, diabetes distress and depressive symptoms differ in their associations with diabetes outcomes in T2D patients. This study proposes a hypothetical model to examine whether self-efficacy mediates the adverse effects of depressive symptoms and/or diabetes distress on self-care behaviors and glycemic control. Additionally, we examined the bi-directional relationships between diabetes distress and depressive symptoms to identify potential underlying mechanisms. This study conducted in 15 rural health clinics in Jiangsu province China. 900 adults with T2D participated in the prospective cohort study. The data Diabetes distress (the 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale, DDS17), depressive symptoms(the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CESD-10), self-efficacy, self-care behaviors (diet and physical activity), metabolic variables (fasting plasma glucose, FPG) and demographic characteristics were assessed at baseline. Subsequent 12-month Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) were measured after baseline. Hierarchical multiple regression and bootstrap mediation analysis were used to test the effects and pathways among these associations. Of 843 participants (93.67%) of total cohort with available subsequent 12-month HbA1c levels, mean age was 66.08 years and 66.55% were women, 25.15% of them had depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥ 10), 12.20% had moderate diabetes distress (mean DDS ≥2) and 4.98% had the both two psychological distress. Hierarchical multiple regression showed higher DDS score significantly predicted unhealthy diet(β = -1.10, P < 0.001) but not physical activities, while CESD score was negatively associated with physical activity (β = -0.06, P < 0.001) but not diet. No independent effects of the two psychological distress variables on subsequent 12-month HbA<sub>1</sub>c were observed. Mediation analysis supported that elevated self-efficacy solely mediated the negative effect of both diabetes distress and depressive symptoms on diet (DDS score: β = -0.238, 95 BCE% CI [-0.350, -0.141]; CESD score: β = -0.010, 95 BCE% CI [-0.016, -0.005]), physical activities (DDS score: β = -0.446, 95 BCE% CI [-0.630, -0.283]; CESD score: β = -0.019, 95 BCE% CI [-0.030, -0.010]) and subsequent 12-month HbA1c (DDS score: β = 0.105, 95 BCE% CI [0.030,0.189]; CESD score: β = 0.004, 95 BCE% CI [0.001,0.009])<sub>.</sub> Additionally, the interplay of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms exerts their effects on diabetes outcomes directly and indirectly via self-efficacy. Self-efficacy may contribute to better diabetes outcomes and ameliorate negative effects of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms.",2022,General hospital psychiatry,Journal Article,2022,YES,sa,How does self-efficacy mediate the impact of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress on physical activity and glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes?,Self-efficacy mitigates the negative effects of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress on physical activity and indirectly improves subsequent 12-month HbA1c levels.,"The abstract shows self-efficacy mediates the adverse effects of depressive symptoms and diabetes distress on physical activity, which influences HbA1c outcomes, highlighting self-efficacy's role in improving diabetes management."
35091900,The Role of Resilience in Psychological Health Among Bariatric Surgery Patients.,"Many individuals who undergo bariatric surgery have experienced repeated unsuccessful diet attempts and negative messages from healthcare providers, family, and others about their weight. Research pre- and post-operatively has taken a pathological or risk-based approach, investigating psychiatric problems and disordered eating. In contrast, the current study explores resilience in this population. Participants were 148 bariatric surgery patients. Participants completed measures pre-operatively and 1.5-3 years post-operatively, including the Binge Eating Scale, Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Questionnaire, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life, Coping Responses Inventory, and Duke Social Support and Stress Scales. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was measured post-operatively. Correlations demonstrated a significant association between post-operative resilience and lower symptoms of binge eating, disordered eating, depression, anxiety, and impact of weight on quality of life. Resilience was also associated with greater social support and less social stress, and greater use of approach coping strategies. Resilience was significantly associated with improvements in symptoms of binge eating, disordered eating, depression, anxiety, and impact of weight on quality of life from pre- to post-operative assessments. In regression models, associations remained significant after controlling for psychosocial variables at baseline (e.g., binge eating symptoms pre-operatively) and demographic covariates. Psychological resilience has been under-studied in the literature on obesity and bariatric surgery, with a primary focus on risk factors for poor outcomes. This study was among the first to investigate associations between resilience and post-operative psychological outcomes. Results suggest the field would benefit from consideration of patient resilience in psychological assessments and interventions.",2022-Mar,Obesity surgery,Journal Article,2022,YES,sa,How is post-operative psychological resilience associated with changes in symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety in bariatric surgery patients?,Post-operative resilience is associated with significant improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-operative assessments.,"The abstract states that resilience correlates with lower depression and anxiety post-operatively and significant symptom improvements over time, even after controlling for baseline psychosocial variables and demographics."
35792299,Affective Control Training (AffeCT) reduces negative affect in depressed individuals.,"Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with prevalence rates rising. Despite the scale of the problem, available pharmacological and psychological interventions only have limited efficacy. The National Institute of Health's Science of Behaviour Change framework proposes to address this issue by capitalising on insights from basic science to identify mechanisms that can be targeted by novel interventions. The current study evaluated the potential of a computerized programme aimed at improving affective control, a mechanistic target involved in both risk and maintenance of depression. In a first phase the cognitive profiles of 48 depressed individuals (mean age: 39 years, 75 % female) were compared to cognitive functioning in 16 never-depressed individuals (mean age: 31 years, 56 % female). The sole index of functioning that differed between diagnostic groups was reaction time across negative and positively valanced trials on an affective Stroop task (d = 0.58). This index was then used to evaluate an affective control training (AffeCT) against a placebo training. Results showed no significant changes on tasks that showed no differences with never-depressed individuals in Phase I. However, compared to placebo training, AffeCT led to significantly greater improvement in the target index, affective Stroop performance (d = 1.17). Importantly, AffeCT led to greater reductions in negative affect as measured by the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule compared to the placebo training (d = 0.98). This proof-of-concept study shows promising benefits of AffeCT on depressed individuals' affect, but not depressive symptoms. It further supports the utility of the Science of Behaviour Change framework, highlighting the need for determining meaningful assays of target mechanisms when evaluating novel interventions.",2022-Sep-15,Journal of affective disorders,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2022,YES,sa,"What cognitive mechanism was specifically targeted by the AffeCT intervention in depressed individuals, and what evidence supports its improvement?","Affective control, evidenced by improved reaction times on affective Stroop tasks (d=1.17).",The abstract identifies affective control as a mechanistic target linked to depression and reports significant improvement in affective Stroop performance following AffeCT training compared to placebo.
35090538,"Efficacy of acupuncture on cognitive function in poststroke depression: study protocol for a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Poststroke depression (PSD) is the most common mental complication after stroke and has a serious impact on functional outcomes and quality of life. Antidepressants are the first-line treatment for PSD, but many reported side effects remain. Clinical research has shown that acupuncture has a positive effect on PSD. This trial aims to study the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PSD and to explore its effect on cognitive function. It is hypothesized that acupuncture treatment improves depressive symptoms, cognitive behavior, and negative emotion processing bias in PSD. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded trial, fifty-six people with PSD will be randomly allocated into the intervention (n=28) or control (n=28) groups. The intervention group will receive acupuncture treatment, and the control group will receive sham acupuncture treatment, in 20 sessions over 4 weeks. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17) scores at week 4. Secondary outcomes include the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and latency and amplitude of P1, N170, and P3 of the event-related potentials (ERPs) components to assess the changes in cognitive function and electroencephalography. Outcomes are assessed at baseline and post intervention.

36035631,Multimorbidity and Mental Health Trajectories Among Middle-Aged and Older U.S. Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Findings From the COVID-19 Coping Study.,"This study aimed to examine the associations between multimorbidity at the COVID-19 pandemic onset and subsequent longitudinal trajectories of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and loneliness in middle-aged and older adults over a 12-month follow-up. Data were from monthly online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study of U.S. adults aged ≥55 from April/May 2020 through April/May 2021 (<i>N</i> = 4,024). Multimorbidity was defined as having ≥2 versus <2 chronic conditions at baseline. Mental health outcomes were assessed monthly as depressive symptoms (8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), anxiety symptoms (5-item Beck Anxiety Inventory), and loneliness (3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale). We used multivariable-adjusted population- and attrition-weighted mixed-effects linear models to examine the longitudinal associations between multimorbidity and mental health symptoms. Multimorbidity at the pandemic onset was associated with elevated depressive (<i>b</i> = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.16-0.59) and anxiety (<i>b</i> = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.15-0.62) symptoms at baseline. Changes in symptoms for all three mental health outcomes were nonlinear over time, with worsening symptoms over the first 6 months of the pandemic (April/May to September/October 2020), followed by improvement in symptoms over the subsequent 6 months (September/October 2020 to April/May 2021). Middle-aged and older adults with multimorbidity experienced faster rates of change in anxiety symptoms and loneliness than those without multimorbidity, with persistently elevated mental health symptomatology throughout the follow-up.

35854250,Effects of group mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and group cognitive behavioural therapy on symptomatic generalized anxiety disorder: a randomized controlled noninferiority trial.,"Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a promising alternative treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The objective of this study was to examine whether the efficacy of group MBCT adapted for treating GAD (MBCT-A) was noninferior to group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) designed to treat GAD (CBT-A), which was considered one of first-line treatments for GAD patients. We also explored the efficacy of MBCT-A in symptomatic GAD patients compared with CBT-A for a variety of outcomes of anxiety symptoms, as well as depressive symptoms, overall illness severity, quality of life and mindfulness. This was a randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial with two arms involving symptomatic GAD patients. Adult patients with GAD (n = 138) were randomized to MBCT-A or CBT-A in addition to treatment as usual (TAU). The primary outcome was the anxiety response rate assessed at 8 weeks after treatment as measured using the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Secondary outcomes included anxiety remission rates, scores on the HAMA, the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), the Severity Subscale of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-S), and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), as well as mindfulness, which was measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Assessments were performed at baseline, 8 weeks after treatment, and 3 months after treatment. Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed for primary analyses. The χ2 test and separate two-way mixed ANOVAs were used for the secondary analyses. ITT and PP analyses showed noninferiority of MBCT-A compared with CBT-A for response rate [ITT rate difference = 7.25% (95% CI: -8.16, 22.65); PP rate difference = 5.85% (95% CI: - 7.83, 19.53)]. The anxiety remission rate, overall illness severity and mindfulness were significantly different between the two groups at 8 weeks. There were no significant differences between the two groups at the 3-month follow-up. No severe adverse events were identified. Our data indicate that MBCT-A was noninferior to CBT-A in reducing anxiety symptoms in GAD patients. Both interventions appeared to be effective for long-term benefits.

Patients with aSAH treated at a single institution (January 1, 2003-December 31, 2019) and a modified Rankin Scale score ≤3 at follow-up who were evaluated for chronic depression were analyzed. Chronic depression was defined using a depression screening questionnaire as ≥5 positive answers for symptoms lasting >2 weeks. A predictive model was designed for the primary outcome of depression. Among 1419 patients with aSAH, 460 patients were analyzed; 130 (28%) had major depressive disorder. Mean follow-up was >6 years. Higher depression rates were associated with tobacco smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 2.64, P < 0.001), illicit drug use (OR = 2.35, P = 0.007), alcohol use disorder (1.92, P = 0.04), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR=2.68, P = 0.03), and vasospasm requiring angioplasty (OR=2.09, P = 0.048).

It is unknown if youth with a parent with T2D (P-T2D) report greater psychological and behavioral symptoms than those without a P-T2D. To compare youth with and without a P-T2D on symptoms of negative affect and disinhibited-eating. Nine-hundred thirty-two youth (13.3 ± 2.6 years; BMIz 1.06 ± 1.06; 67.8% female; 53.6% people of color; 10.7% with a P-T2D) completed questionnaires of anxiety and depressive symptoms, eating in the absence of hunger, and emotional-eating. Loss-of-control (LOC)-eating was assessed by interview. In two separate subsamples, energy intake was explored using laboratory test meals simulating eating in the absence of hunger and LOC-eating, respectively. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity. In follow-up analyses, fat mass (kg) and height, and IR were included as covariates, respectively. Adjusting for all covariates including adiposity and IR, compared to youth without a P-T2D, youth with a P-T2D reported more anxiety and depression symptoms, greater eating in the absence of hunger, and emotional-eating (ps < 0.05).

36042423,Economic burden of major depressive disorder: a case study in Southern Iran.,"Depression disorders are a leading cause of disability in the world which imposes a significant economic burden on patients and societies The present study aimed to determine the economic burden of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) on the patients referred to the reference psychiatric single-specialty hospitals in southern Iran in 2020. This cross-sectional research is a partial economic evaluation and a cost-of-illness study conducted in southern Iran in 2020. A total of 563 patients were enrolled through the census method, and a researcher-made data collection form was used to gather the required information. The prevalence-based and the bottom-up approaches were also used to collect the cost information and calculate the costs, respectively. The data on direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs were obtained using the information in the patients' medical records and insurance bills as well as their self-reports or those of their companions. To calculate the indirect costs, the human capital approach was used as well. The results showed that the annual cost of MDD was $ 2717.41 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) (USD 2026.13) per patient in 2020. Direct medical costs accounted for the largest share of the costs (73.68%), of which hoteling and regular beds expenses were the highest (57.70% of the total direct medical costs). The shares of direct non-medical and indirect costs were 7.52 and 18.80%, respectively, and the economic burden of the disease in the country was estimated at $7,120,456,596 PPP (USD 5,309,088,699). In general, due to the high prevalence of MDD and the chronicity of the disease, the costs of its treatment can impose a heavy economic burden on the society, healthcare system, insurance system, and the patients themselves.

36060727,Left intermittent theta burst stimulation combined with right low-frequency rTMS as an additional treatment for major depression: A retrospective study.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depression (MD). We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) combined with low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) on the right DLPFC as an additional therapy to standard medication treatment. The study included 54 patients with MD who completed 10 courses (5 days per week) of rTMS as an add-on therapy. Thirty patients were treated in the combination group (120% resting motor threshold; left DLPFC, iTBS, 600 stimuli + right DLPFC, 1-Hz rTMS, 600 stimuli), while 24 patients were in the high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) group (120% resting motor threshold; left DLPFC, 10-Hz rTMS, 3000 stimuli). The outcome was assessed based on the changes in scores of 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) and 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA-14). Both depression and anxiety were significantly improved after 2 weeks of treatment by rTMS combined with medication. The combination of iTBS and LF-rTMS was significantly superior to HF-rTMS in improving the scores of HAMD-24 (<i>P</i> = 0.041) and HAMA-14 (<i>P</i> = 0.0095), and the response rate (<i>P</i> = 0.027). The pilot study showed that the combination of iTBS and LF-rTMS may hold promise as a potentially effective alternative therapy for MD due to its efficacy and time-saving benefit.

Data were obtained from mothers (N = 714) and children (N = 768) from the Hamamatsu Birth Cohort for Mothers and Children. Maternal depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale at 2, 4, 10 weeks and 10 months postpartum. Children's internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 6 years and 8-9 years old. Mothers were divided into 4 groups based on the trajectory of their PPD persistence: ""No PPD,"" ""Transient PPD,"" ""Worsening PPD"" and ""Persistent PPD."" Linear regression analysis was used to examine the association of PPD persistence and severity with children's internalizing and externalizing problems. ""Persistent PPD"" was significantly associated with children's internalizing problems at 6 years old (Coefficient [95%CI] = 2.74 [1.30-4.19], P < .001), but no association was found at 8-9 years old. No associations were found between PPD severity and children's internalizing and externalizing problems in either age category. ""Persistent PPD"" and ""Worsening PPD"" groups had a relatively small sample size. The mothers' depression statuses were not ascertained simultaneously with the children's behavioral assessments.

36573298,Blunted reward responsiveness prospectively predicts emotional distress when exposed to a naturalistic stressor.,"Both stress and blunted reward responsiveness have been identified as core risk factors of depression. Whether blunted reward responsiveness increases psychological vulnerability to real-life stress from a dynamic perspective (from stress reactivity to recovery) has not been investigated. By utilizing a real-world stressful event (i.e. the final examination), this study aimed to explore the role of reward responsiveness in the stress-emotional distress relationship during stress reactivity and recovery phases. We followed 57 undergraduates with three assessments, from six weeks before examination weeks (T1, baseline), one day before the examinations (T2) to two weeks after the examinations (T3), therefore, covering stress reactivity (T1 to T2) and recovery (T2 to T3) phases. At baseline, reward responsiveness was measured as the Reward Positivity (RewP) in the doors task. Stress and emotional distress (anxiety and depression) were reported at T1, T2 and T3 to capture their dynamic changes. Results showed that self-report stress levels significantly increased from T1 to T2 (stress reactivity phase) and decreased from T2 to T3 (stress recovery phase). Furthermore, blunted reward responsiveness at baseline prospectively predicted emotional distress during the stress reactivity phase but not the recovery phase. Specifically, during the stress reactivity phase, higher perceived stress was associated with greater anxiety and depression only in participants with relatively smaller residual RewP amplitudes but not in participants with relatively larger residual RewP amplitudes. Our study demonstrated that a blunted reward responsiveness is a vulnerable factor of depression, especially when exposed to stress.

36045387,"Effectiveness of the internet-based Unified Protocol transdiagnostic intervention for the treatment of depression, anxiety and related disorders in a primary care setting: a randomized controlled trial.","Research has shown that internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) can be a very promising solution to increase access to and the dissemination of evidence-based treatments to all of the population in need. However, iCBT is still underutilized in clinical contexts, such as primary care. In order to achieve the effective implementation of these protocols, more studies in ecological settings are needed. The Unified Protocol (UP) is a transdiagnostic CBT protocol for the treatment of emotional disorders, which includes depression, anxiety and related disorders, that has shown its efficacy across different contexts and populations. An internet-based UP (iUP) programme has recently been developed as an emerging internet-based treatment for emotional disorders. However, the internet-delivered version of the UP (iUP) has not yet been examined empirically. The current project seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the iUP as a treatment for depression, anxiety and related emotional disorders in a primary care public health setting. The current study will employ a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design. Participants will be randomly assigned to (a) the internet-based Unified Protocol (iUP), or (b) enhanced waiting list control (eWLC). Randomization will follow a 2:1 allocation ratio, with sample size calculations suggesting a required sample of 120 (iUP=80; eWLC=40). The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will be used for assessing potential participants. The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) and the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) as well as other standardized questionnaires will be used for assessments at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks from baseline and for the iUP condition during the follow-up. Combining the advantages of a transdiagnostic treatment with an online delivery format may have the potential to significantly lower the burden of emotional disorders in public health primary care setting. Anxiety and depression, often comorbid, are the most prevalent psychological disorders in primary care. Because the iUP allows for the treatment of different disorders and comorbidity, this treatment could represent an adequate choice for patients that demand mental health care in a primary care setting.

36353465,Validation and Functional Relevance of the Short Form of the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression for Japanese Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"To validate the five-item version of the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire for Depression (PDQ-D-5) for assessing subjective cognitive function in Japanese patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) using data from the PERFORM-J study. A total of 518 Japanese outpatients diagnosed with MDD were assessed on severity of depressive symptoms, cognitive function, social and work function, and quality of life (QoL) over 6 months following initiation of antidepressant therapy. This post hoc analysis evaluated the internal consistency and convergent validity of the PDQ-D-5 in relation to the original PDQ-D-20. Correlations of scores on these measures were examined at each time point and over time. The same set of analyses was explored between PDQ-D-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-nine-item (PHQ-9), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), five-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire. PDQ-D-5 scores showed good internal consistency. Strong positive correlations were observed between PDQ-D-5 and PDQ-D-20 at each time point (correlation coefficient: baseline, 0.94; month 1, 0.94; month 2, 0.96; month 6, 0.96) and over time (0.92) (all p < 0.0001). Longitudinally, there were positive correlations between PDQ-D-5 scores versus those on the PHQ-9, MADRS, and SDS. Similarly, negative correlations were noted between PDQ-D-5 scores and EQ-5D-5L and DSST scores to a variable degree. There were moderate positive correlations over time between PDQ-D-5 and all WPAI subscale scores except those on absenteeism. PDQ-D-5 scores rated in Japanese patients with MDD were found to adequately represent scores on the PDQ-D-20. The short version also showed associations with several measures of functional outcome, depression severity and QoL.

35232221,Supportive Evidence: Brief Supportive Psychotherapy as Active Control and Clinical Intervention.,"Supportive psychotherapy has long had an undeservedly weak reputation. This review aims to describe the use of manualized, time-limited brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP) and its testing in clinical trials across three decades. Although numerous clinical descriptions of supportive psychotherapy exist, its use is reportedly widespread, and several supportive psychotherapies have been used in psychotherapy trials, BSP is the first and sole supportive psychotherapy manualized for research. BSP was designed as a nondirective, affect-focused, bare-bones common-factors treatment. Collecting data from the nine randomized controlled trials involving BSP, eight of them published, the author presents a narrative summary of findings. Eight trials addressed mood disorders and one addressed social anxiety disorder. Sample size varied. Most BSP trials resulted in ""dead heat"" comparable outcomes. BSP generally showed large effect sizes for improvement on the primary outcome variable (range d=0.62-1.01). Delivering it won over some therapists from exposure-based backgrounds. Despite its perennial role as an unfavored control condition, BSP held its own in competition with more symptom-focused therapies, usually producing a dead-heat outcome.

Empirical work on perceived dignity is relatively scant, but it stands to reason that one source of dignity might be gathered through religion/spirituality, especially through one's relationship with God or a divine power. In this study, we test whether attachment to God may protect against the hypothesized negative mental health consequences of having low perceptions of dignity. Using nationally representative data from the 2017 Baylor Religion Survey (N = 1375), we find that lower perceptions of dignity were associated with higher depression and anxiety. We found that for respondents with low self-perceptions of dignity, stronger feelings of secure attachment to God attenuated (weakened) the otherwise positive association between low dignity and greater depression and anxiety. Taken together, a secure attachment to God could lead believers to confront challenges and problems, including one's dignity being undermined, with confidence and security.

31256606,Predictors of Depression and Anxiety in Family Members 3 Months After Child's Admission to a Pediatric ICU.,"Family members of children admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) suffer from severe stress, which sometimes results in long-term psychological problems. We aimed to identify associations between demographic and psychosocial variables at early stages of a child's admission to the ICU and depression and anxiety in family members at approximately 3 months after admission. We also explored predictive models for depression and anxiety at 3 months after admission. This study is a secondary analysis of data from a previous clinical trial of palliative care for family members in ICUs, in which 380 family members of 220 children reported demographic and psychosocial status at approximately 1 week after ICU admission (baseline), at discharge from the ICUs, and at 3 months after the child's admission to the ICU. Clinical data were extracted from the children's medical records. We used linear regression models and stepwise linear regression for the analyses. After controlling for significant confounders of gender (female) and child mortality, worse psychological status at baseline, represented by reported depression, anxiety, and acute stress symptoms, was associated with more severe depression and anxiety at 3 months. Also, a better family relationship at baseline was associated with lower depression and anxiety at 3 months. We suggest a need to screen family members of children admitted to the ICU with validated scales and intervening with those at high risk of depression and anxiety.

31071541,Hippocampal volume and depression among young children.,"Clinical depression can occur in young children as early as age three. This very early onset variant of depression shows the same clinical features with developmental adjustments as depression that onsets later in life. One robust neural feature of adult depression is reduced hippocampal volume. We measured hippocampal volume in a sample of 35 children aged 4-7 who were either in a clinical trial for preschool onset depression or were recruited from the community. We used T1 MPRAGE acquisitions on a Siemen's Scanner, with Freesurfer 5.3 used to segment the hippocampus. Depression was measured using the K-SADS early childhood (K-SADS-EC) to create a dimensional depression severity score and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Depression T-Score. Multilevel models indicated that greater depression severity as measured by either the CBCL Depression Score or the K-SADS-EC was associated with lower hippocampal volume, even controlling for total gray matter, maternal depression, income-to-needs ratio, and stressful life events. These data indicate evidence for reduced hippocampal volume among children with PO-MDD who were more severely depressed.

31027682,Insomnia and depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition: theoretical and therapeutic implications of a self-reinforcing feedback loop.,"Insomnia is a common and recurring condition during the menopausal transition that negatively affects both quality of life and health. Peri-menopausal insomnia has a multifactorial etiology; previous depression, hormonal changes and age/hormone-related irregularity in circadian rhythms can contribute to menopausal insomnia. Age-related poor health, pain and stress may favor the development of insomnia, while vasomotor symptoms, in particular hot flashes, may contribute to chronic forms of insomnia by activating a vicious cycle. Insomnia increases two- to threefold the risk of developing depressive symptoms during the peri-menopause. In fact, the menopausal transition is a window of vulnerability for the development of depressive symptoms, in which the risk of a major depressive disorder is 2-4 times greater than in the premenopausal period. Depression naturally has a negative impact on daily functioning, quality of life and health. Since the relationship between insomnia and depressive symptoms has been shown to be bidirectional, the aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of their association in the context of the menopausal transition. By exploring the potential pathways of their bidirectional relationship, this overview should be useful for preventive and therapeutic purposes.

These results should encourage teams working in palliative care to conduct more studies to determine the benefits of Reiki therapy on pain, anxiety/depression and quality of life in palliative care.",2019-Dec,BMJ supportive & palliative care,,2019,YES,sa,What is a potential limitation in generalizing the benefits of Reiki therapy for managing anxiety or depression in palliative care patients?,The small number of studies limits clear identification of benefits.,"The abstract states that the limited number of studies in palliative care prevents definitive conclusions about Reiki's effectiveness for anxiety/depression, despite preliminary positive effects."
30832633,Comparison of exhaustion symptoms in patients with stress-related and other psychiatric and somatic diagnoses.,"Several rating scales assessing stress-related symptoms of exhaustion have emerged in recent years. However, more knowledge is needed about the performance of these rating scales in patients with stress-related disorders as well as in other patient groups. With the recently developed Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS), we compared symptoms of exhaustion in different patient groups that were sorted according to diagnosis. Patients were sampled consecutively from departments of occupational medicine (DOM) at three Danish hospitals. The total study group comprised 698 care-seeking patients (487 women). Patients with stress-related diagnoses (n = 217; the International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10 code F43: reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorder) were compared to a diverse group of patients with a range of somatic diagnoses (n = 338) and to patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (n = 143), including subgroups with major depression disorder (n = 34; F32 and F33) and problems related to employment and unemployment (n = 99; Z56). The data were analysed using linear mixed models with the SPSS statistical program. The mean KEDS sum score in patients with stress-related diagnoses (29.3; SD = 8.0) was significantly higher than in patients with other psychiatric diagnoses (25.9; SD = 9.5) and in patients with somatic diagnoses (17.6; SD = 10.8). The subgroup with a major depression disorder had high mean KEDS sum scores (31.4, SD = 8.1), similar to patients with stress-related diagnoses, while the mean KEDS sum score in patients with problems related to employment and unemployment (Z56) was 23.5 (SD = 9.0). Young and old patients scored similarly on KEDS, but in patients with somatic diagnoses, female patients scored significantly higher than male patients. The symptoms of exhaustion measured with KEDS were higher in patients with stress-related diagnoses and major depression disorder than in patients with somatic diagnoses. The intermediate level of the symptoms of exhaustion that were associated with problems related to employment and unemployment, (Z56) compared to the lower level of the symptoms with somatic diagnoses, suggests that KEDS might be useful in detecting mild, prodromal states of exhaustion. This needs further investigation.",2019-Mar-04,BMC psychiatry,,2019,YES,sa,How might the Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS) differentiate between major depression disorder and adjustment disorder in clinical practice?,"Both disorders show high KEDS scores, but adjustment disorder patients score slightly lower on average than those with major depression disorder.","The abstract states that patients with major depression disorder had a mean KEDS score of 31.4, while those with stress-related diagnoses (including adjustment disorder) scored 29.3, indicating nuanced differences in exhaustion severity."
31202891,Activation of WNT and CREB signaling pathways in human neuronal cells in response to the Omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).,"A subset of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) elects treatment with complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs), including the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Previous studies in rodents suggest that DHA modulates neurodevelopmental processes, including adult neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms of DHA's potential therapeutic effect in the context of human neurobiology have not been well established. Here we sought to address this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of DHA using human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and post-mitotic neurons using pathway-selective reporter genes, multiplexed mRNA expression profiling, and a panel of metabolism-based viability assays. Finally, real-time, live-cell imaging was employed to monitor neurite outgrowth upon DHA treatment. Overall, these studies showed that DHA treatment (0-50 μM) significantly upregulated both WNT and CREB signaling pathways in human neuronal cells in a dose-dependent manner with 2- to 3-fold increases in pathway activation. Additionally, we observed that DHA treatment enhanced survival of iPSC-derived NPCs and differentiation of post-mitotic neurons with live-cell imaging, revealing increased neurite outgrowth with DHA treatment within 24 h. Taken together, this study provides evidence that DHA treatment activates critical pathways regulating neuroplasticity, which may contribute to enhanced neuronal cell viability and neuronal connectivity. The extent to which these pathways represent molecular mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids in MDD and other brain disorders merits further investigation.",2019-Sep,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,,2019,YES,sa,"Which intracellular signaling pathways are upregulated in human neuronal cells by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment, and how might this relate to potential therapeutic effects in major depressive disorder (MDD)?",WNT and CREB pathways; they regulate neuroplasticity.,"The abstract states that DHA upregulates WNT and CREB signaling in human neuronal cells, enhancing neuroplasticity, neuronal viability, and connectivity.

30991255,The gut-brain relationship: Investigating the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of healthy young adults.,"There has been an increased interest in understanding the therapeutic effect of gut-microbiota on health, particularly in mental health. However, limited research into the connection between gut-microbiota and mental health makes this study an important endeavor in exploring the effect of gut-microbiota, through probiotics intervention, on mental health like anxiety and factors related to anxiety (e.g., anxiety control, affect, negative mood regulation, and worry). Healthy college students (N = 86; 75.6% female), average age of 20.59, participated in a double-blind, placebo-control, and randomization-control study. Eligible participants completed a baseline survey before being assigned to a condition, which consisted of four probiotics conditions and one placebo condition. After 28 days of daily intake, the participants returned to complete their exit survey. Probiotics were observed to improve panic anxiety, neurophysiological anxiety, negative affect, worry, and increase negative mood regulation. Furthermore, post hoc analyses revealed that the CFU (colony-forming unit) level was more effective than species counts in accounting for the number of significant improvements. A ceiling effect was detected in the study, participants with high distress reported higher number of improvements than those with normative distress. Overall, this study is the first to examine the effect of CFU and species count on probiotics' efficacy. The study's finding suggested that probiotics may have the therapeutic potential to treat anxiety, however, further research is necessary to make that determination.",2019-Jun-01,Journal of affective disorders,,2019,YES,sa,How might probiotics' colony-forming unit (CFU) levels influence therapeutic outcomes in patients with clinical anxiety disorders?,"Higher CFU levels may improve panic anxiety, neurophysiological anxiety, negative affect, worry, and mood regulation more effectively than species count.","The abstract indicates that CFU levels were more effective than species counts in producing significant improvements in anxiety-related symptoms, suggesting CFU levels play a critical role in probiotics' therapeutic efficacy."
30646205,Evaluation of the Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action Among Latino Immigrants With Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Misuse Symptoms: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Immigrants are at an increased risk for co-occurring mental health and substance misuse symptoms; however, effective treatments are lacking. To evaluate the effectiveness of the Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action (IIDEA) program compared with enhanced usual care. This effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 2, 2014, to February 2, 2017, in 17 clinics or emergency departments and 24 community sites in Boston, Massachusetts, as well as in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. Equal randomization (1:1) in 2-person blocks was used, assigning participants to either the IIDEA treatment group (n = 172) or the enhanced usual care control group (n = 169). Intent-to-treat analyses assessed effectiveness, and post hoc analyses examined whether results varied by symptom severity or treatment dose. Eligible participants were between 18 and 70 years of age, self-identified as Latino, screened positive for co-occurring symptoms, and were not receiving specialty behavioral health services. Participants were randomized to a 10-session IIDEA treatment or to enhanced usual care. Primary outcomes were changes in alcohol and drug misuse and results of a urine test for drug metabolites but not for alcohol misuse. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and overall mental health. In total, 341 participants were randomized to either the IIDEA treatment group (n = 172; 94 [54.7%] female, mean [SD] age, 33.5 [11.6] years) or the enhanced usual care control group (n = 169; 80 [47.3%] female, mean [SD] age, 34.3 [11.8] years). No statistically significant effects of IIDEA were found for primary drug and alcohol outcomes (ASI Lite-drug score: β = -0.02 [SE, 0.69; P = .88; Cohen d, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.17]; ASI Lite-alcohol score: β = -0.01 [SE, 1.19; P = .66; Cohen d, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.12 to 0.12]; urine drug test result: β = -0.36 [SE, 0.43; P = .50; OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.30-1.61]), but statistically significant effects were observed for secondary mental health outcomes. The IIDEA treatment was effective in reducing depressive symptoms per the Public Health Questionnaire-9 score (β = -1.14; SE, 0.47; P = .02; Cohen d, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.04-0.36]), posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms per the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 score (β = -3.23; SE, 1.59; P = .04; Cohen d, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.01-0.37]), and overall mental health symptoms per the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-20 (β = -0.20; SE, 0.07; P = .01; Cohen d, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.08-0.42]) and composite mental health (β = -3.70; SE, 1.75; P = .04; Cohen d, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.01-0.36]) scores at the 6-month follow-up. Exploratory analyses suggested that 6-month treatment effects occurred for patients whose drug misuse was moderate to severe at the baseline assessment. Among patients with moderate to severe substance misuse, IIDEA substantially reduced substance use per the urine test results (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.67]; P = .01). Treatment dose showed small to large effect sizes by outcome. The IIDEA treatment did not change drug misuse but did improve secondary mental health and substance misuse outcomes for a heterogeneous population with moderate to severe symptoms; this finding provides a path for treating Latino immigrants with co-occurring mental health and substance misuse symptoms.

Here we examine urinary function and psychosocial stressors and their association with poor mental health in a younger group of prostate cancer survivors who have undergone curative treatment. The study includes 128 men (47 to 70 years old) who received active treatment for prostate cancer, and completed a survivorship online survey between 2017 and 2018. Psychological distress was assessed with Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. International Prostate Symptom Score subscales (incomplete urinary emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining and nocturia) and number of current prostate cancer survivorship stressors were predictors. Multivariate logistic regression was used to fit the model while controlling for months of survivorship since diagnosis, the presence or absence of surgery, radiation or hormone therapy treatment, current medication for depression and demographics. A total of 19.5% of men scored positive for current mental health issues. Prostate cancer survivors who reported increased number of current survivorship stressors (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.01), had higher frequency of urination (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.15-3.64), history of radiation treatment (OR 7.15, 95% CI 1.02-50.35) and were currently on prescribed medication for depression (OR 33.47, 95% CI 3.80-294.87) had higher odds for screening positive for psychological distress compared with their counterparts.

29808770,Risk of Depression after Traumatic Brain Injury in a Large National Sample.,"Depression is associated with poorer recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet awareness of depression risk post-TBI among providers and patients is low. The aim of this study was to estimate risk of depression post-TBI among adults 18 years of age and older and to identify risk factors associated with developing depression post-TBI. We conducted a retrospective, matched cohort study using claims data for privately insured and Medicare Advantage enrollees in a large U.S. health plan. Adults ≥18 years of age diagnosed with TBI (n = 207,354) with 12 months continuous insurance coverage pre-TBI and 24 months post-TBI were matched to controls without TBI (n = 414,708). We identified the presence of depression on any in- or outpatient claim occurring during the study period (both before and after TBI). Of the initial 622,062 individuals, 62,963 (10%) had depression pre-TBI and were excluded from incidence calculations. Incidence of depression post-TBI was 79.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.5,80.5) per 1,000 person-years compared to 33.5 (95% CI, 33.1,34.0) per 1,000 person-years for those without TBI.

The recent emergence of the 'top girl' identity, a new cultural slot on offer for young women, is underpinned by the rise of neoliberal and post-feminist discourses in the Western world. To explore whether this new feminine subjectivity is indeed taken up by young women and how it shapes their experience of depression, we conducted in-depth interviews with 13 young professional women in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Based on a dialogical approach to theorising and researching subjectivity, we identified repetitive inter-relations between different voices-of-the-self and the voices of depression. The most pervasive pattern in the sample consists of what we have termed <i>demanding voices</i> associated with the 'top girl' position, which construct depression as an individual deficit thereby discouraging young women from exploring the sociocultural origins of their distress. In contrast, <i>resistant voices</i> emphasise relationality and a (re)connection with meaningful values and, therefore, seem to be productive for individual recovery.",2020-Nov,"Health (London, England : 1997)",,2019,YES,sa,How might neoliberal and post-feminist cultural discourses influence the way young professional women interpret and cope with clinical depression?,"Neoliberal and post-feminist discourses promote 'top girl' identities, framing depression as an individual deficit and discouraging exploration of sociocultural distress origins.","The abstract highlights 'top girl' identities shaped by neoliberal and post-feminist discourses, which foster demanding voices that attribute depression to personal failure rather than sociocultural factors, affecting coping strategies."
30922834,"Cannabinoids, interoception, and anxiety.","The use of cannabis is rapidly gaining legal status across North America. Such dramatic legislative shifts have prompted an urgency in elucidating the stimulus effects of cannabis consumption. Cannabis use, though relatively safe compared to other drugs of abuse, has been associated with greater risk of mental health disorders, possibly via its primary psychoactive constituent, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In this review, we discuss endocannabinoid activation and cannabis constituents from the perspective of subjective interoceptive (internally-perceived) states and how that relates to anxiety. Human studies have examined these subjective effects through use of self-report questionnaires. However, non-human studies use proxy methods of assessing anxiety states, such as elevated plus maze and fear conditioning paradigms. So far, this body of research has demonstrated that both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoid activation generally elicits biphasic effects on expression of the subjective state, with lower doses appearing to have anxiolytic properties and higher doses perceived as anxiogenic. Unfortunately, research with these compounds has been historically limited due to excessively tight regulatory control. Therefore, much work remains regarding the investigation of interactions between cannabinoid receptor activity and cannabis constituents on anxiety.

30626568,YouthCHAT as a Primary Care E-Screening Tool for Mental Health Issues Among Te Tai Tokerau Youth: Protocol for a Co-Design Study.,"In New Zealand (NZ), 1 in 4 adolescents is affected by mental health issues (eg, depression and anxiety) and engages in risk behaviors (eg, harmful drinking and substance abuse), with rates among Māori youth being significantly higher. The majority of NZ secondary school students visit their local primary health care providers (PHPs) at least annually, yet most do not seek help for mental health and risk behavior (MHB) concerns. While youth think it acceptable to discuss sensitive issues during a consultation with their PHPs, unless problems are severe, such conversations are not initiated by PHPs. Early intervention for MHB concerns can prevent long-term health and well-being issues. However, this relies on the early identification of developing problems and youth being offered and accepting help. YouthCHAT is an electronic, multi-item screening tool developed in 2016 to assess MHB concerns among youth. YouthCHAT is completed before a consultation with the PHP, who can access a summary report straight away. A help question allows young people to identify issues that need addressing. A resource pack uses stepped care pathways to guide providers to use appropriate brief interventions. This study aimed to explore the utility, feasibility, and acceptability of YouthCHAT when tailored for use with youth in primary care settings with large Māori populations. Objectives of the study are to evaluate the implementation of YouthCHAT in nurse-led youth clinics, school-based clinics, and general practice in Te Tai Tokerau (Northland, NZ); to develop a framework for the scaling up of YouthCHAT across further settings; to assess health provider and youth acceptability of the tool; to improve screening rates for mental health and help-seeking behavior; to enable early identification of emerging problems; and to improve brief intervention delivery. Using a bicultural mixed-methods co-design approach, 3 phases over a 3-year period will provide an iterative evaluation of the utility, feasibility, and acceptability of YouthCHAT, aiming to create a framework for wider-scale rollout and implementation. Recruitment for the first phase began in September 2018. YouthCHAT was implemented at the first site in October 2018 and is expected to be at a further two sites in late January to early February 2019. The study is due for completion at the end of 2021. YouthCHAT has potential as a user-friendly, time efficient, and culturally safe screening tool for early detection of MHB issues in NZ youth. The resource pack assists the clinician to provide appropriate interventions for emerging and developed youth mental health and lifestyle issues. Involving input from community providers, users, and stakeholders will ensure that modifiable elements of YouthCHAT are tailored to meet the health needs specific to each context and will have a positive influence on future mental, physical, and social outcomes for NZ youth.

30795491,Predicting persistent depressive symptoms in older adults: A machine learning approach to personalised mental healthcare.,"Depression causes significant physical and psychosocial morbidity. Predicting persistence of depressive symptoms could permit targeted prevention, and lessen the burden of depression. Machine learning is a rapidly expanding field, and such approaches offer powerful predictive abilities. We investigated the utility of a machine learning approach to predict the persistence of depressive symptoms in older adults. Baseline demographic and psychometric data from 284 patients were used to predict the likelihood of older adults having persistent depressive symptoms after 12 months, using a machine learning approach ('extreme gradient boosting'). Predictive performance was compared to a conventional statistical approach (logistic regression). Data were drawn from the 'treatment-as-usual' arm of the CASPER (CollAborative care and active surveillance for Screen-Positive EldeRs with subthreshold depression) trial. Predictive performance was superior using machine learning compared to logistic regression (mean AUC 0.72 vs. 0.67, p < 0.0001). Using machine learning, an average of 89% of those predicted to have PHQ-9 scores above threshold at 12 months actually did, compared to 78% using logistic regression. However, mean negative predictive values were somewhat lower for the machine learning approach (45% vs. 35%). A relatively small sample size potentially limited the predictive power of the algorithm. In addition, PHQ-9 scores were used as an indicator of persistent depressive symptoms, and whilst well validated, a clinical interview would have been preferable. Overall, our findings support the potential application of machine learning in personalised mental healthcare.",2019-Mar-01,Journal of affective disorders,,2019,YES,sa,What machine learning method demonstrated superior predictive performance over logistic regression in identifying persistent depressive symptoms in older adults after 12 months?,Extreme gradient boosting.,"The abstract specifies that extreme gradient boosting outperformed logistic regression in predicting persistent depressive symptoms, with a higher mean AUC (0.72 vs. 0.67) and better positive predictive value (89% vs. 78%)."
30684045,Fear of disease progression in adult ambulatory patients with brain cancer: prevalence and clinical correlates.,"Fear of progression (FoP) is frequent in patients with cancer and of high clinical relevance. Despite the often devastating prognosis of brain cancer, FoP has not yet been assessed in neurooncological patients. The aim of this study was thus the assessment of FoP and its clinical correlates. In an ambulatory setting, 42 patients with a primary brain tumour completed the Fear of Progression questionnaire FoP-Q-12. Clinical correlates of FoP were assessed via a variety of measures, including patients' physical state (Karnofsky Performance Status, KPS), cancer-related psychosocial distress (Distress Thermometer, DT), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder Scale, GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), Quality of Life (Short Form Health Survey, SF-8), and unmet supportive care needs (Supportive Care Needs Survey, SCNS). Eighteen patients (42%) suffered from high FoP (i.e. scored ≥ 34 in the FoP-Q-12). According to the 12 items of the FoP-Q-12, the greatest fears were worrying about what would happen to their family and being afraid of severe medical treatments. No sociodemographic variables (e.g. age, gender) or medical tumour characteristics (e.g. tumour malignancy, first or recurrent tumour) were related to FoP. Patients with more severe physical symptoms reported higher FoP. Patients with higher FoP were more anxious, more depressed, reported lower Quality of Life, and suffered from more unmet supportive care needs. Our results demonstrate that FoP is frequent and of high clinical relevance for neurooncological patients. Its assessment is not sufficiently covered by instruments for assessment of other areas of psychological morbidity (e.g. general anxiety). Moreover, FoP cannot be predicted by objective characteristics of the patients and disease. Thus, the routine screening for FoP is recommended in neurooncological patients. Clinicians should bear in mind that patients with high FoP are likely to suffer from high emotional distress and unmet supportive care needs and initiate treatment accordingly.",2019-Sep,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,,2019,YES,sa,What psychological factor should clinicians prioritize screening for in neurooncological patients with high levels of anxiety and depression?,Fear of progression (FoP).,"FoP is strongly associated with higher anxiety, depression, lower quality of life, and unmet supportive care needs, making it clinically relevant for neurooncological patients."

Despite the achievement of hematological remission, patients may report persisting neurological impairment that affects their quality of life. To assess the long-term neuropsychological consequences of acute TTP, we recruited 35 acquired TTP patients (77% females, median age at onset 41 years, interquartile range: 35-48) regularly followed at our out-patient clinic of thrombotic microangiopathies in Milan (Italy) from December 2015 to October 2016. Patients underwent a psychological evaluation of memory and attentional functions, emotional wellbeing and health-related quality of life at least three months after their last acute TTP event (median 36 months, interquartile range: 17-54). During the psychological consultation, 17 patients (49%) referred persisting subjective neurological impairment in the frame of a remission phase, with at least one symptom as disorientation, loss of concentration, dizziness, lack of balance, headache and diplopia. Neuropsychological assessment revealed lower scores than the Italian general population pertaining to direct, indirect and deferred memory. A higher degree of impairment of memory domains was found in patients with neurological involvement at the time of presentation of the first acute TTP episode. Anxiety and depression were detected in seven (20%) and 15 (43%) patients, respectively. Health-related quality of life was lower than the Italian general population, with mental domains more impacted than physical domains (mean difference 58.43, 95% confidence interval: 71.49-45.37).

31836015,Longitudinal trajectories of comorbid PTSD and depression symptoms among U.S. service members and veterans.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study examined longitudinal trajectories of PTSD and MDD symptoms among service members and veterans with comorbid PTSD/MDD. Eligible participants (n = 1704) for the Millennium Cohort Study included those who screened positive at baseline for both PTSD (PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version) and MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire). Between 2001 and 2016, participants completed a baseline assessment and up to 4 follow-up assessments approximately every 3 years. Mixture modeling simultaneously determined trajectories of comorbid PTSD and MDD symptoms. Multinomial regression determined factors associated with latent class membership. Four distinct classes (chronic, relapse, gradual recovery, and rapid recovery) described symptom trajectories of PTSD/MDD. Membership in the chronic class was associated with older age, service branch, deployment with combat, anxiety, physical assault, disabling injury/illness, bodily pain, high levels of somatic symptoms, and less social support. Comorbid PTSD/MDD symptoms tend to move in tandem, and, although the largest class remitted symptoms, almost 25% of participants reported chronic comorbid symptoms across all time points.

Aromatase, the product of the CYP19A1 gene, is the key enzyme in the conversion of androgen to estrogen. Whether CYP19A1 variants could be associated with depression differently in men and women has not been examined. This population-based study included 405 men and 602 women aged ≥65 years. A clinical level of depression (DEP) was defined as having a score ≥16 on the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale or a diagnosis of current major depression based on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview and according to DSM-IV criteria. Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the CYP19A1 gene were genotyped and circulating levels of estradiol and testosterone were determined. Multivariable analyses were adjusted for age, body mass index, ischemic pathologies, cognitive impairment, and anxiety. Five SNPs were associated with DEP in women specifically and this varied according to a history of major depression (p-values .01 to .0005). Three SNPs were associated with an increased risk of late-life DEP in women without a history of major depression, while two SNPs were associated with a decreased DEP risk in women with a history of major depression and were also associated with higher estradiol levels.

31533269,Identifying the Factors Related to Depressive Symptoms Amongst Community-Dwelling Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"High-level depressive symptoms have been reported in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), resulting in increased risk of progression to dementia. However, studies investigating the correlates of depressive symptoms among this population are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the significant socio-demographic, lifestyle-related and disease-related correlates of depressive symptoms among this cohort. Cross-sectional data were obtained from a sample of 154 Chinese community-dwelling older adults with MCI. MCI subjects were screened by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale. Possible correlates of depressive symptoms in individuals with MCI were explored by multiple linear regressions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among Chinese older adults with MCI was 31.8%. In multiple regression analysis, poor perceived positive social interaction, small social network, low level of physical activity, poor functional status, subjective memory complaint, and poor health perception were correlated with depressive symptoms. The findings highlight that depressive symptoms are sufficient to warrant evaluation and management in older adults with MCI.

The rats were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with LiCl (127 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (40 mg/kg) to induce SE. A video surveillance system was used to monitor SRS in the post-SE model for 6 weeks (from the onset of the 2nd week to the end of the 7th week after SE induction). TPPU (0.1 mg/kg/d) was intragastrically given for 4 weeks from the 21st day after SE induction in the SRS + 0.1 TPPU group. The SRS + PEG 400 group was given the vehicle (40% polyethylene glycol 400) instead, and the control group was given LiCl and PEG 400 but not pilocarpine. The sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swim test (FST) were conducted to evaluate the depression-like behaviours of rats. Immunofluorescent staining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and western blot analysis were performed to measure astrocytic and microglial gliosis, neuronal loss, and levels of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), cytokines [tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6], and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB). The frequency of SRS was significantly decreased at 6 weeks and 7 weeks after SE induction in the 0.1TPP U group compared with the SRS + PEG 400 group. The immobility time (IMT) evaluated by FST was significantly decreased, whereas the climbing time (CMT) was increased, and the sucrose preference rate (SPR) evaluated by SPT was in an increasing trend. The levels of sEH, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were all significantly increased in the SRS + PEG 400 group compared with the control group; neuronal loss, astrogliosis, and microglial activation were also observed. The astrocytic and microglial activation and levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the Hip and PFC were significantly attenuated in the TPPU group compared with the SRS + PEG 400 group; moreover, neuronal loss and the decreased CREB expression were significantly alleviated as well.

For example, early emotion regulation is learned primarily in the context of mother-child interaction, which may allow for maternal influences to shape children's social-emotional development. The aim of the current study was to longitudinally examine maternal determinants of children's early social-emotional development in a community-based sample of first-time mothers (N = 61, aged 22-39 years). Specifically, we used structural equation modeling to examine how maternal emotion regulation difficulties and subclinical depression directly and indirectly, through sensitivity and postnatal bonding, assessed at 6 to 8 months predicted child outcomes at 12 to 16 months. We found that mothers' sensitivity predicted fewer social-emotional and behavioral problems and that stronger bonding predicted fewer problems and more social-emotional competencies. Emotion regulation difficulties were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; yet, when accounting for shared variances, both factors differentially predicted less positive child outcomes such that more difficulties indirectly, through poorer bonding, predicted greater delay in competencies, and more symptoms indirectly, through less sensitivity, predicted more problems.

To investigate whether individual differences in symptoms of depression, borderline personality pathology or adverse childhood events would: (1) influence ratings of BA treatment credibility; (2) predict credibility rating differences in comparison to schema therapy (ST) exemplifying a contrasting theoretical rationale with a significant developmental history focus; (3) a third aim was to test whether BA credibility was increased by providing research evidence of its efficacy. In an online within-subjects experiment, 219 Australian community adults completed the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire following written descriptions of BA and ST (presentation order randomized across participants), and again for BA after receiving information about research supporting BA's efficacy. Higher childhood adversity (but not severity of depression or borderline personality disorder symptoms) predicted lower BA credibility. Overall, ST was rated more credible than BA, but presenting BA evidence increased BA credibility ratings to match ST. This response was moderated by individual differences: participants with higher childhood adversity or previous therapy experience found ST more credible than BA even after receiving BA evidence.

28657697,Vascular risk factors in older patients with depression: outcome of electroconvulsive therapy versus medication.,"Research suggests that in depression, vascular burden predicts a lower efficacy for medication (MED) and a more favourable outcome for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Therefore, we investigated the influence of the following vascular risk factors (VRF): hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cerebral vascular accident/transient ischemic attack, on remission from major depression after ECT versus MED. The study sample consisted of 81 inpatients with a DSM-IV unipolar major depression diagnosis (mean age 72.2 years, SD = 7.6, mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score 32.9, SD = 6.2) participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing nortriptyline versus venlafaxine and 43 inpatients (mean age 73.7 years, SD = 7.5, mean Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score 30.6, SD = 7.1) from an randomized controlled trial comparing brief pulse versus ultrabrief pulse ECT. The presence of VRF was established from the medical records. The remission rate of patients with VRF was compared with those of patients without VRF. The remission rate was 58% (19/33) in the ECT group with ≥1 VRF and 32% (23/73) in the MED group with ≥1 VRF (χ<sup>2</sup>  = 6.456, p = 0.011). Comparing patients with no VRF versus ≥1 VRF, the remission rate decreased from 80 to 58% (χ<sup>2</sup>  = 1.652, p = 0.276) in ECT patients and from 38 to 32% (χ<sup>2</sup>  = 0.119, p = 0.707) in MED patients.

30366227,Ruminative response style is associated with a negative bias in the perception of emotional facial expressions in healthy women without a history of clinical depression.,"Rumination has been shown to be an important cognitive vulnerability factor affecting development and maintenance of depression. Ruminative thinking can be divided into a self-focused component referring to persistent reflection about causes and consequences of depressed mood and a symptom-focused component characterized by repetitive thinking about depressive symptoms. Previous research on clinical depression has shown that rumination is associated with the perception of negative emotions in others' facial expressions. The present study was conducted to investigate the relation between habitual rumination and negative bias in face perception in healthy individuals. 100 healthy young women without a history of clinical depression completed the Response Styles Questionnaire along with measures of depressive symptoms, dysfunctional attitudes, and anxiety. A computer-based version of the perception of facial expressions questionnaire using line drawings (schematic faces) was administered to assess perceived emotions in faces with ambiguous and unambiguous emotional expressions. According to hierarchical regression analyses, symptom-based (but not self-focused) rumination predicted perceived negative emotions in ambiguous as well as in unambiguous negative faces after controlling for current depressive symptoms, state and trait anxiety, intelligence, and dysfunctional attitudes. Generalization of the present findings is limited by the fact that only women were included as study participants. Habitual ruminating about depressive symptoms in healthy, never clinically depressed individuals goes along with a negative bias in the perception of others' facial expressions.

29489046,Suicidal ideation in military veterans with alcohol dependence and PTSD: The role of hostility.,"Suicide is a significant public health problem among US military Veterans with rates exceeding civilian samples. Alcohol dependence (AD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are both associated with increases in suicidality. Given that risk of suicide is higher among those with both disorders, the study of relevant risk factors among those in this group is important. The current investigation focused on one such factor, hostility, and examined both overt hostility (ie, hostility that is more behavioral in nature and directed outwardly) and covert hostility (ie, hostility that is cognitive in nature and introspective) and their relationships to suicidal ideation. Ninety-three Veterans participating in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study evaluating the efficacy of the alpha-adrenergic agonist prazosin completed measures assessing overt hostility, covert hostility, and suicidal ideation at baseline. Depression symptoms and PTSD symptom severity also were assessed. Of the total sample, 60 participants (63.8%) indicated that they experienced suicidal ideation at some point in their lives. Covert hostility, in addition to PTSD symptom severity were found to be associated with the presence of lifetime suicidal ideation. Furthermore, depression symptoms were found to be associated with greater intensity of that ideation.

Given the explosion of research focused on the microbiota-gut-brain axis, consideration has turned to the potential of certain probiotics to improve patient outcomes for those suffering from mood disorders. Here we examine the abilities of a known antidepressant, fluoxetine, and the probiotic <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> JB-1™, to attenuate responses to two established criteria for depressive-like behavior in animal models, the tail suspension test (TST) and the corticosterone response to an acute restraint stressor. We examine two different strains of mice known to differ in the extent to which they express both anxiety-like behavior and measures of despair-BALB/c and Swiss Webster-with respectively high and normal behavioral phenotypes for each. While adult male BALB/c mice responded with increased antidepressive-like behavior to both fluoxetine and <i>L. rhamnosus</i> JB-1 in both the TST and the corticosterone stress response, SW mice did not respond to either treatment as compared to controls. These findings highlight the importance of investigating putative antidepressants in mouse strains known to express face validity for some markers of depression. Clinical studies examining the activity of <i>L. rhamnosus</i> JB-1 in patients suffering from mood disorders are warranted, as well as further pre-clinical work examining how interactions between host genotype and intestinal microbial alterations may impact behavioral responses.

30135030,"Etifoxine impairs neither alertness nor cognitive functions of the elderly: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study.","Etifoxine hydrochloride (Stresam<sup>®</sup>), a treatment indicated for psychosomatic manifestations of anxiety, could be an alternative to benzodiazepines. While no impact on alertness and cognitive functions has been proven among youth, data on elderly are lacking. The primary objective of this study was to measure the impact of etifoxine, lorazepam or placebo on alertness in the elderly. The secondary objectives were to evaluate cognitive performances and adverse effects. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-way crossover design, 30 healthy volunteers aged 65 to 75 years underwent three one-day sessions. After treatment intake, standardized cognitive tests were conducted using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries and other psychological tests (Stroop, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span). The reaction time (RTI) as primary endpoint was analysed using a 3 × 3 latin square variance analysis. A 100-mg dose of etifoxine has no deleterious impact on alertness and causes no cognitive disorders as compared to placebo (RTI: 744 ± 146 ms versus 770 ± 153 ms; p = 1.00). As expected, a 2-mg dose of lorazepam impairs alertness (RTI: 957 ± 251 ms versus placebo; p < 0.0001) and cognitive functions. A similar frequency of adverse events was observed with etifoxine and placebo while their incidence was 3-fold higher with lorazepam, drowsiness being the most frequent adverse event.

29423279,Physiotherapy for people with mental health problems in Sub-Saharan African countries: a systematic review.,"There is a need for psychosocial interventions to address the escalating mental health burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Physiotherapists could have a central role in reducing the burden and facilitating recovery within the multidisciplinary care of people with mental health problems. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the role of physiotherapists within the current mental health policies of SSA countries and to explore the current research evidence for physiotherapy to improve functional outcomes in people with mental health problems in SSA. The Mental Health Atlas and MiNDbank of the World Health Organization were screened for the role of physiotherapy in mental health plans. Next, we systematically searched PubMed from inception until August 1st, 2017 for relevant studies on physiotherapy interventions in people with mental health problems in SSA. The following search strategy was used: ""physiotherapy"" OR ""physical therapy"" OR ""rehabilitation"" AND ""mental"" OR ""depression"" OR ""psychosis"" OR ""schizophrenia"" OR ""bipolar"" AND the name of the country. The current systematic review shows that in 22 screened plans only 2 made reference to the importance of considering physiotherapy within the multidisciplinary treatment. The current evidence (N studies = 3; n participants = 94) shows that aerobic exercise might reduce depression and improve psychological quality of life, self-esteem, body image and emotional stress in people with HIV having mental health problems. In people with depression moderate to high but not light intensity aerobic exercise results in significantly less depressive symptoms (<i>N</i> = 1, <i>n</i> = 30). Finally, there is evidence for reduction in post-traumatic stress symptoms (avoidance and arousal), anxiety and depression following body awareness related exercises (N = 1, <i>n</i> = 26). Our review demonstrated that physiotherapy is still largely neglected in the mental health care systems of SSA. This is probably due to poor knowledge of the benefits of physiotherapy within mental health care by policymakers, training institutes, and other mental health care professionals in SSA.

30515280,Fruit and vegetable intakes in relation to behavioral outcomes associated with a nutrition education intervention in preschoolers.,"Although a lot of effort has been put into increasing fruit and vegetable intakes in preschool children, vegetable intake in this group is still low. This study investigated whether nutrition education focusing on fruit and vegetable intakes can affect preschoolers' fruit and vegetable intakes as well as their behavioral outcomes. Thirty-five preschoolers (54.3% boys, n = 19) aged 4-6 years residing in Seoul underwent weekly nutrition education intervention (8 sessions) between May and July 2016. Intakes of fruits and vegetables were measured during pre and post-intervention. At snack time, fresh fruit (150 g) and vegetable (120 g) snacks were distributed to each child by teachers. The remaining portions of the snacks were weighed and recorded for each child. Behavioral outcomes were measured by applying Child behavior checklist 1.5-5 and the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. During post intervention, vegetable intake increased from 36.15 ± 30.64 g to 48.01 ± 31.23 g (<i>P</i> = 0.010). Among the emotional and behavioral problems measured by parents, levels of total problems (<i>P</i> = 0.001), internalizing (<i>P</i> = 0.004), externalizing (<i>P</i> = 0.003), anxiety and depression (<i>P</i> = 0.001), and aggressive behavior (<i>P</i> = 0.005) decreased. Anxiety (<i>P</i> = 0.026) score, as measured by teachers, also decreased. Nutrition education of preschoolers regarding the intakes of fruits and vegetables had a positive effect on preschoolers' vegetable intake as well as on their emotional and behavioral outcomes.

The present study investigated anger and depressive rumination as correlates of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Cross-sectional confirmatory factor analyses on data from 764 young adults from the Colorado Longitudinal Twin Study indicated that anger and depressive rumination were separable at the latent variable level, and were both associated with lifetime symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. However, depressive rumination was more strongly associated with psychopathology than was anger rumination. Further analysis indicated that depressive rumination was independently associated with internalizing psychopathology, whereas associations between anger rumination and psychopathology were predominately due to shared variance with depressive rumination. Anger rumination was independently associated with externalizing psychopathology in women and was inversely associated with internalizing psychopathology in men. This result supports the clinical relevance of ruminative thought processes and the potential differential utility of anger and depressive content for understanding internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.",2018-Feb,Clinical psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science,,2018,YES,sa,How do depressive rumination and anger rumination differentially contribute to internalizing psychopathology in men?,"Depressive rumination is positively associated with internalizing psychopathology, while anger rumination is inversely associated with internalizing psychopathology in men.","The abstract indicates depressive rumination independently predicts internalizing psychopathology, whereas anger rumination shows an inverse relationship with internalizing psychopathology in men, highlighting distinct roles of these ruminative processes."

30186306,Neurogranin and BACE1 in CSF as Potential Biomarkers Differentiating Depression with Cognitive Deficits from Early Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) can cooccur with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) or may cause memory problems independently of AD. Previous studies have suggested that the AD-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers tau and Aβ(1-42) could help discriminate between early AD and depression unrelated to AD. Moreover, the postsynaptic protein neurogranin and presynaptic BACE1 have increasingly gained attention as potential new AD biomarkers, but they have not yet been investigated concerning depression. Using ELISAs, we studied CSF neurogranin and BACE1 levels in patients with mild (<i>n</i> = 21) and moderate (<i>n</i> = 19) AD, as well as in MDD patients with (<i>n</i> = 20) and without (<i>n</i> = 20) cognitive deficits. The clinical examinations included analyses of t-tau, Aβ(1-42), and Aβ(1-40), besides neuropsychological tests and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Along with classic AD biomarkers, neurogranin and BACE1 CSF levels differed between moderate AD and MDD (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.01). MDD associated with cognitive deficits was distinguished from mild AD through the CSF neurogranin/BACE1 ratio (<i>p</i> < 0.05), which was strongly correlated with GDS scores (ρ = -0.656; <i>p</i> < 0.01).

29512454,A System Pharmacology Study for Deciphering Anti Depression Activity of Nardostachys jatamansi.,"The plant Nardostachys jatamansi from Valerianaceae family is a well known antidepressant plant and has historically been used in traditional medicine. As N. jatamansi contains many different compounds, to identify its mechanisms of action, we need a network-based study. Network-based studies are becoming an increasingly important tool in understanding the mechanisms of actions of drugs. Systems pharmacology (SP) and bioinformatics are two emerging tools that use computation to develop an understanding of drug actions in molecular and cellular levels. SP can provide mechanistic understanding of protein-protein (drug-target) interaction involved in a common biological pathway. The present study was undertaken to identify unknown targets and mechanisms of antidepressant activity of N. jatamansi according to a systems pharmacology approach. First of all a list of all the targets (receptors and metabolites) involved in depression process were provided based on KEGG database. The 3D structures of protein targets were collected as PDB files and their active sites coordinates were found. In the next step the structures of known compounds of N. jatamansi were collected. For identifying the protein-lagand interactions, a docking process was run in AutoDock and an output was received. To complete our study, the similarity between antidepressant conventional drugs and N. jatamansi compounds was analyzed. A SP map figured by Cytoscape Software, shows the relations between herbal compounds, molecular targets and depression. According to the docking results, we can suggest several important targets that we have no drugs for, or several natural compounds that play an important role in depression process. According to the similarity results we can suggest several molecules for extraction or synthesis that need more researches for their therapeutic effects.

30560177,The interaction of depression and prior opioid use on pain and opioid requirements after total joint arthroplasty.,"Preoperative opioid use causes increased pain and opioid requirements after total joint arthroplasty (TJA), but the effect of depression on this relationship is not well defined. We conducted a retrospective review of primary TJA patients using an institutional database. Demographic variables, inpatient opioid requirements, and discharge prescription quantities were collected and compared between patients with and without a prior diagnosis of depression in both the prior opioid-using and nonusing cohorts. Four hundred and three patients were analyzed between August 1, 2016, and July 31, 2017. Among prior opioid users, patients with depression experienced higher inpatient pain levels (4 vs 3; <i>P</i> = .001), required more inpatient opioids (117 oral morphine equivalents [OMEs] vs 70 OMEs; <i>P</i> = .022), were prescribed more opioids at discharge (1163 OMEs vs 750 OMEs; <i>P</i> = .02), and required more long-term opioid refills (57.7% vs 15.4%; <i>P</i> < .001) than patients without depression. However, depression was not associated with increased pain, opioid requirements, prescription quantities, or refill rates among opioid-naive patients. Depression is not associated with increased pain or opioid requirements among opioid-naive patients after TJA but is associated with significantly higher pain and opioid requirements among patients who use opioids preoperatively.

29486869,"Neural Signaling of Cortisol, Childhood Emotional Abuse, and Depression-Related Memory Bias.","Cortisol has potent effects on learning and neuroplasticity, but little is known about its effects on negative memory biases in depression. Animal models show that aversive caregiving alters effects of glucocorticoids (primarily corticosterone in rodents and cortisol in primates) on learning and neuroplasticity into adulthood. We investigated whether history of childhood emotional abuse (EA) moderated effects of cortisol administration (CORT) versus placebo on emotional memory formation in depression. Participants included 75 unmedicated women with varying levels of depression severity and/or EA history. In a double-blind crossover investigation, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure effects of CORT (vs. placebo) on neural function during emotional memory formation. CORT eliminated the well-known relationship between depression severity and negative memory bias, a finding explained by EA severity. For women with a history of severe EA, CORT reduced depression-related negative memory bias and normalized recall for pleasant stimuli. EA severity also moderated CORT effects on neural function: in women with history of severe EA, CORT increased activation in the supplementary motor area during viewing of unpleasant relative to pleasant pictures. Additionally, supplementary motor area activation predicted reduced negative bias for pictures encoded during CORT. These results suggest that increasing cortisol signaling may be neurocognitively beneficial in depressed women with a history of maltreatment. The findings corroborate prior research suggesting that presence or absence of adverse caregiving is etiologically important in depression.

To quantify psychiatric comorbidity and its outcome effects in a large, multicenter population of inpatients with orthopedic injuries. Retrospective analysis of patient discharge data from 507 California hospitals from 2001 to 2010. Study sample included orthopedic diagnoses using International Classification of Diseases codes for major pelvic and lower extremity injuries in patients older than age 17 years. From the injury data, we extracted psychiatric diagnoses, alcoholism, substance abuse, and sociodemographic characteristics. Length of stay, surgical complications, and inpatient deaths. The entire injury admissions represented about 1.9% of all hospital admissions and were predominantly older than age 64 years, white, and women with conventional health care insurance. The most common comorbidity in the patients with injury was psychiatric illness (24.7%). The most common psychiatric diagnoses in orthopedic injury admissions were dementia (14.3%) and depression (6.9%) without association. Compared with the injury admissions with no psychiatric diagnosis, admissions with psychiatric diagnosis had higher odds of a hospital stay of 7 or more days, surgical treatment complications, and inhospital death. Psychiatric comorbidity adversely affects several hospital outcomes in patients with orthopedic injuries: Length of stay, surgical complications, and inpatient mortality.

For the primary outcomes, target benchmarks were exceeded by observed rates for all participants for feasibility (consent 74%, randomisation 91%, retention 83%), acceptability (mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 27.6 (SD 3.8)) and usability (mean Systems Usability Score 89.1 (SD 11.5)). For secondary outcomes, mean values (and 95% CIs) reflected clinically significant group-based changes on the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (mobile (-4.8 (-6.6, -2.9)), telephone (-3.9 (-5.6, -2.2)), education (-3.0 (-5.3, 0.8)); the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (mobile -2.1 (-3.7, -0.5), telephone -1.6 (-3.0, -0.1), education -0.6 (-2.5, 1.3)); the Post-Traumatic Stress Scale (mobile -2.6 (-6.3, 1.2), telephone -2.2 (-5.6, 1.2), education -3.5 (-8.0, 1.0)); and the Patient Health Questionnaire physical symptom scale (mobile -5.3 (-7.0, -3.7), telephone -3.7 (-5.2, 2.2), education -4.8 (-6.8, 2.7)). Among ICU patients, a mobile mindfulness app initiated after hospital discharge demonstrated evidence of feasibility, acceptability and usability and had a similar impact on psychological distress and physical symptoms as a therapist-led programme.

29412335,Art therapy as an adjuvant treatment for depression in elderly women: a randomized controlled trial.,"There are few quantitative studies on art therapy for the treatment of depression. The objective of this study was to evaluate if art therapy is beneficial as an adjuvant treatment for depression in the elderly. A randomized, controlled, single-blind study was carried out in a sample of elderly women with major depressive disorder (MDD) stable on pharmacotherapy. The experimental group (EG) was assigned to 20 weekly art therapy sessions (90 min/session). The control group (CG) was not subjected to any adjuvant intervention. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after 20 weeks, using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and cognitive measures. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age revealed that women in EG (n=31) had significant improvement in GDS (p = 0.007), BDI (p = 0.025), and BAI (p = 0.032) scores as compared with controls (n=25).

30197587,Anxiety Specific Response and Contribution of Active Hippocampal Neural Stem Cells to Chronic Pain Through Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Mice.,"Chronic pain usually results in persistent anxiety, which worsens the life quality of patients and complicates the treatment of pain. Hippocampus is one of the few brain regions in many mammalians species which harbors adult neural stem cells (NSCs), and plays a key role in the development and maintenance of chronic anxiety. Recent studies have suggested a potential involvement of hippocampal neurogenesis in modulating chronic pain. Whether and how hippocampal NSCs are involved in the pain-associated anxiety remains unclear. Here, we report that mice suffering persistent neuropathic pain showed a quick reduction of active NSCs in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), which was followed by the decrease of neurogenesis and appearance of anxiety. Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a key pathway in sustaining the active status of NSCs was suppressed in the vDG of mice suffering chronic pain. Depleting β-catenin by inducible Nestin-Cre significantly reduced the number of active NSCs and facilitated anxiety development, while expressing stabilized β-catenin amplified active NSCs and alleviated anxiety, indicating that Wnt activated NSCs is required for anxiety development under chronic pain. Treatment with Fluoxetine, the most widely used anxiolytic in clinic, significantly increased the proliferation of active NSCs and enhanced Wnt signaling. Interestingly, both β-catenin manipulation and Fluoxetine treatment had no significant effects on the pain thresholds. Therefore, our data demonstrated an anxiety-specific response and contribution of activated NSCs to chronic pain through Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which may be targeted for treating chronic pain- or other diseases-associated anxiety.",2018,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,,2018,YES,sa,"What is the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the development of anxiety associated with chronic pain, and how does Fluoxetine influence this pathway?","Wnt/β-catenin signaling sustains active hippocampal NSCs, which modulate anxiety in chronic pain.

29323626,A Scenario-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Mobile App to Reduce Dysfunctional Beliefs in Individuals with Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"While self-administered mobile app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app-based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. Thirty-four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT-based mobile-app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow-up evaluation. After completing the 3-week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores and situation-dependent trait version of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-X2) at follow-up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI-X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI-II and STAI-X2 scores.

29403280,The impact of age of onset on amygdala intrinsic connectivity in major depression.,"Early-onset major depressive disorder (EO-MDD), beginning during childhood and adolescence, is associated with more illness burden and a worse prognosis than adult-onset MDD (AO-MDD), but little is known about the neural features distinguishing these subgroup phenotypes. Functional abnormalities of the amygdala are central to major depressive disorder (MDD) neurobiology; therefore, we examined whether amygdala intrinsic connectivity (IC) can differentiate EO-MDD from AO-MDD in a cohort of adult MDD patients. Twenty-one EO-MDD (age of onset ≤18 years), 31 AO-MDD patients (age of onset ≥19 years), and 19 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (7 minutes). Amygdala seed-based resting-state functional connectivity was compared between groups. AO-MDD patients showed loss of inverse left amygdala-left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex IC and increased inverse left amygdala-left inferior parietal IC, compared to both HCs and EO-MDD. EO-MDD showed a switch from inverse to positive IC with right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, compared to HCs and AO-MDD. This effect was removed when we controlled for illness burden. Alterations in amygdala IC with the default-mode network were specifically related to EO-MDD, whereas amygdala IC with executive cognitive control regions was preferentially disrupted in AO-MDD. Increased illness burden, an important clinical marker of EO-MDD, accounted for its specific effects on amygdala IC. Brain imaging has the potential for validation of clinical subtypes and can provide markers of prognostic value in MDD patients.",2018,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,,2018,YES,sa,How does early-onset major depressive disorder (EO-MDD) differ from adult-onset MDD (AO-MDD) in terms of amygdala intrinsic connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex?,"EO-MDD shows a switch from inverse to positive intrinsic connectivity with the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, unlike AO-MDD.","The abstract states EO-MDD exhibits positive amygdala connectivity with the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, distinguishing it from AO-MDD, which lacks this specific alteration."

29940010,Validation of a new study skills scale to provide an explanation for depressive symptoms among medical students.,"Medical students are faced with enormous academic demands that may influence their emotional wellbeing. The high rate of depression among medical students and its negative impact is an impetus to find explanation for the factors associated with it. Study skills that students possess might be such a factor. The current tools for the assessment of the study skills may have certain limitations, particularly for different cultural settings. This study aimed to develop and validate a Study Skills Inventory (SSI), and to investigate the relationship between the students' study skills and the extent (severity) of depressive symptoms, measured using the validated tool. The first version of the SSI was developed through expert consensus. The inventory was then administered to a randomly selected group of medical students. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for the internal validity. External validation was conducted by comparing the results of the SSI with the ""Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students"" (ASSIST). After validation, the correlation between the SSI total score with the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) total score was investigated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The means of the total study skills scores for each severity category of depression were compared using ANOVA. A total of 23 items, representing five sub-scales, were included in the inventory. Based on 372 student responses (response rate of 93%), the five-factor solution explained a cumulative variance of 52% and Cronach alpha was 0.84. The SSI total score had a significant negative association with the BDI-II depression score (Pearson correlation of -.348** and P<0.0001). This study showed evidence for acceptable reliability and validity of the newly developed SSI. Poor study skills were found to correlate with higher depressive symptoms.

30043270,Moving to Beat Anxiety: Epidemiology and Therapeutic Issues with Physical Activity for Anxiety.,"The purpose of this paper was to provide a comprehensive narrative review of the relationship between physical activity (PA) and anxiety and the rationale for including it as a treatment option for anxiety disorders. Several gaps in the literature are highlighted alongside recommendations for future research. PA in the general population has established efficacy in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease and improving wellbeing. Recent epidemiological data further suggests that people who are more active may be less likely to have anxiety disorders. In addition, evidence from systematic reviews of randomised control trials suggests that exercise training, a subset of PA, can reduce symptoms in anxiety and stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia and panic disorder. Anxiety disorders are common, burdensome and costly to individuals and wider society. In addition to the profound negative impact on individuals' wellbeing and functioning, they are associated with worsened physical health, including a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Although pharmacotherapy and psychological interventions are helpful for many, these treatment approaches are not effective for everyone and are insufficient to address common physical health complications, such as the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Given the combined anxiolytic and physical health benefits of increased activity, PA presents a promising additional treatment option for people with anxiety disorders. However, there remain key gaps in the literature regarding the mechanisms underlying the effects of PA, optimal PA protocols, methods of improving adherence and the importance of physical fitness. These must be addressed for PA to be successfully implemented in mental health services.",2018-Jul-24,Current psychiatry reports,,2018,YES,sa,What are two key reasons physical activity might be considered a promising adjunctive treatment for anxiety disorders?,"Physical activity offers combined anxiolytic effects and physical health benefits, including reduced cardiovascular risk and improved overall wellbeing.","The abstract highlights that PA reduces anxiety symptoms, improves physical health, mitigates cardiovascular risks, and addresses limitations of pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy in managing physical health complications in anxiety disorders."

This review examines the literature on women's experiences with postpartum generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), postpartum panic disorder (PD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and reference lists were searched. Qualitative and quantitative studies assessing women's experiences with GAD, postpartum PD, OCD, and PTSD were included. Narrative approach to literature synthesis was used. Fourteen studies (among 44 articles) met the criteria for review to identify descriptions of women's cognitive, affective, and somatic experiences related to postpartum anxiety disorders. Loss, frustration, and guilt, accompanied by physical symptoms of tension, were some of the experiences identified across studies. Most women suffered from more than one anxiety disorder, in addition to postpartum depression. To date, research has focused on prevalence rates of postpartum anxiety disorders, and evidence about clinical and subclinical symptoms of postpartum anxiety disorders and outcomes on mother and child is lacking. Postpartum anxiety disorders may have negative effects on parenting and child development; however, the nature of the underlying mechanisms is unclear.

29744872,Profound consequences of hidradenitis suppurativa: a review.,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) influences patients' lives in many ways. The most troublesome symptom of HS is chronic pain, of mild-to-moderate intensity, which is reported by almost all patients. With reference to psychosocial evaluation, HS appears to be a highly debilitating disease. The major factors influencing patients' well-being are disease severity, the number of flares or affected skin areas, and the lesion location. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index scores of 8·3-12·7 points obtained among patients with HS are typical for severe dermatoses, which have a large impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). HS not only affects skin-related QoL issues, but also has a profound impact on general QoL measures - it causes substantial deterioration of both physical and mental health. Considering the impaired QoL due to HS and HS-associated, nonpsychiatric comorbidities, it is not surprising that patients with HS experience psychological disturbances. In both observational and registry studies, depression and anxiety were significantly related to HS. The prevalences were estimated as 1·6-42·9% and 0·8-3·9%, respectively. HS was also linked to feelings of loneliness and stigmatization. Moreover, these patients have a significantly increased suicide risk (hazard ratio 2·42). HS, with its frequent involvement of the genital area, causes a pronounced impairment of sex life (66·7% of patients with HS reported sexual difficulties).

29872299,The characteristics of understanding of depression among older patients treated with antidepressants: a comparison between older and younger patients.,"To reveal characteristics of understanding of depression among older patients, we reanalyzed the data from a previous study of patients who were administered antidepressants. A total of 424 outpatients were enrolled in this study. We used an original self-administered questionnaire consisting of eight items: depressive symptoms, the course of depression, the cause of depression, the treatment plan, the duration of antidepressant use, how to discontinue antidepressants, the side effects of antidepressants, and psychotherapy. Each item consisted of the following two questions: ""Have you received an explanation from the doctor in charge?"" and ""How much do you understand about your treatment?"". The level of understanding was rated on a scale of 0-10 (11 anchor points). Subjects were divided into two groups: younger patients who were <65 years of age and older patients who were ≥65 years of age. Older patients with depression showed lower levels of understanding of depression and did not receive sufficient psychoeducation from their physicians, but their understanding of depression might not be associated with their remission. In the younger group, the scores of understanding of the course of depression, the treatment plan, how to discontinue antidepressants, and psychotherapy items, and the total understanding score of remitters, were significantly higher than those of non-remitters. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the items score or total score between remitters and non-remitters in the older group.

29777939,"Variation of genes encoding KAT1, AADAT and IDO1 as a potential risk of depression development.","Numerous data suggests that the disorders of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs) pathway, including a decreased level of tryptophan or evaluated concentration of harmful TRYCATs -kynurenine, quinolinic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, 3-hydroxytryptophan - may cause the occurrence of DD symptoms. In this work, we assessed the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KAT1, KAT2 and IDO1 gene encoding, and the risk of depression development. Our study was performed on the DNA isolated from peripheral blood of 281 depressed patients and 236 controls. We genotyped, by using TaqMan probes, four polymorphisms: c.*456G > A of KAT1 (rs10988134), c.975-7T > C of AADAT (rs1480544), c.-1849C > A (rs3824259) and c.-1493G > C(rs10089084)of IDO1. We found that only the A/A genotype of c.*456G > A - KAT1 (rs10988134) increased the risk of depression occurrence. Interestingly, when we stratified the study group according to gender, this relationship was present only in male population.

The functional connectivity (FC) networks were constructed by thresholding Pearson correlation metrics of the DMN regions defined by group independent component analysis, and their topological properties (e.g. small-world and network efficiency) were analyzed using graph theory-based approaches. Relative to the healthy controls, the RGD patients showed decreased FC in the posterior regions of the DMN (i.e. the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, angular gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus). Furthermore, the RGD patients showed abnormal global topology of the DMN (i.e. increased characteristic path length and reduced global efficiency) when compared with healthy controls. Importantly, significant correlations between these network measures and cognitive performance indicated their potential use as biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction in RGD. The present study indicated disrupted FC and topological organization of the DMN in the context of RGD, and further implied their contribution to cognitive deficits in RGD patients.",2018-May,International psychogeriatrics,,2018,YES,sa,What specific alterations in the default-mode network's functional connectivity and topology are associated with remitted geriatric depression?,"Decreased functional connectivity in posterior DMN regions and disrupted global topology, including increased path length and reduced global efficiency.","The abstract highlights reduced functional connectivity in posterior DMN regions and abnormal topology measures (e.g., increased path length, reduced efficiency) as key disruptions linked to remitted geriatric depression."
29754863,Relationships of Anxiety and Depression with Cardiovascular Health in Youth with Normal Weight to Severe Obesity.,"To evaluate the relationships of depression and anxiety symptoms with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and measures of vascular health in youth. Participants (n = 202) were 8- to 18-year-olds from a cross-sectional study evaluating cardiovascular health across a wide range of body mass index values (normal weight to severe obesity). CVD risk measurement included blood pressure, fasting lipids, glucose, insulin, carotid artery intima-media thickness, compliance and distensibility, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, carotid-radial artery pulse wave velocity, body fat percentage, and a metabolic syndrome cluster score. Anxiety and depression symptoms were self-reported on the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children. Two sets of adjustment variables were used in evaluation of differences between those with and without anxiety or depression symptomatology for the CVD risk factor and vascular outcomes. The first set included adjustment for Tanner stage, sex, and race; the second was additionally adjusted for percent body fat. Anxiety was not significantly associated with CVD risk factors or vascular health in either model. Depression was associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome cluster score; these relationships were attenuated when accounting for percent body fat. When accounting for body fat, we found no clear relationship of self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms with CVD risk factors or vascular health in youth.",2018-Aug,The Journal of pediatrics,,2018,YES,sa,How might body fat percentage influence the relationship between depression symptoms and cardiovascular disease risk factors in youth?,"Body fat percentage attenuates the relationship between depression symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors such as HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome cluster score.","The abstract indicates that depression's associations with CVD risk factors were reduced when body fat percentage was accounted for, suggesting body fat mediates these relationships in youth."

29440210,Factors associated with health literacy in multimorbid patients in primary care: a cross-sectional study in Switzerland.,"To identify factors associated with health literacy in multimorbid patients. A nationwide cross-sectional study in Switzerland. Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were calculated to identify variables associated with health literacy. A multiple imputation approach was used to deal with missing values. Multimorbid patients recruited in primary care settings (n=888), above 18 years old and suffering from at least 3 of 75 chronic conditions on a predefined list based on the International Classification of Primary Care 2. Health literacy was assessed using the European Health Literacy Survey project questionnaire (HLS-EU 6). This comprises six items scored from 1 to 4 (very difficult=1, fairly difficult=2, fairly easy=3, very easy=4), and the total health literacy score is computed as their mean. As we wished to understand the determinants associated with lower health literacy, the HLS-EU 6 score was the only dependent variable; all other covariates were considered independent. The mean health literacy score (SD) was 2.9 (0.5). Multivariate analyses found significant associations between low health literacy scores and treatment burden scores (β=-0.004, 95% CI -0.006 to 0.002); marital status, predominantly the divorced group (β=0.136, 95% CI 0.012 to 0.260); dimensions of the EuroQuol 5 Dimension 3 Level (EQ5D3L) quality of life assessment, that is, for moderate problems with mobility (β=-0.086, 95% CI -0.157 to 0.016); and with moderate problems (β=-0.129, 95% CI -0.198 to 0.060) and severe problems with anxiety/depression (β=-0.343, 95% CI -0.500 to 0.186).

38232635,The independent and joint effect of socioeconomic status and Multiracial status on the prevalence and frequency of substance use and depression among U.S. adolescents.,"While the United States is becoming increasingly Multiracial, much is still unknown about the behavioral health of these growing new generations of Multiracial Americans. To narrow this research gap, this study investigated the prevalence/frequency of substance use and major depressive episodes [MDE] among non-Hispanic Multiracial [NHM] adolescents compared to their non-Hispanic White [NHW] counterparts and whether racial differences vary by socioeconomic status. We analyzed data from the 2015-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N = 3,645 NHM and 34,776 NHW adolescents aged 12-17). Average Marginal Effects derived from logistic regression and negative binomial regression were used to examine (1) differences in six outcomes (past-month use of alcohol, cannabis, or drugs other than cannabis [DOTC], past-year MDE, and the frequency of alcohol and cannabis use among past-month users) by Multiracial status; (2) the moderation effect of family income on these associations. Compared to high-income NHW adolescents, high-income NHM adolescents reported significantly higher prevalence of past-month cannabis and DOTC use, and past-year MDE. No racial differences were observed at other income levels. Furthermore, moderation analyses indicated that the effect of Multiracial status on MDE was larger in the highest income group compared to the lowest income group. Our findings suggested that NHM adolescents, particularly those from high income families, exhibit increased prevalence of drug use and depression than NHW adolescents.

38380213,Behind the Mask: Parkinson's Disease and Depression.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, prevalent neurodegenerative disease. It is mainly characterized by motor symptoms such as rigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia, but it can also manifest with non-motor symptoms, of which depression is the most frequent. The latter can impair the quality of life, yet it gets overlooked and goes untreated because of the significant overlap in their clinical features, hence making the diagnosis difficult. Furthermore, there is limited data on the availability of appropriate criteria for making the diagnosis of depression in PD patients, as it can occur with varying expressions throughout the course of PD or it can also precede it. This review article has included a brief discussion on the diagnosis of depression in PD patients and their overlapped clinical manifestations. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the disease processes of PD and depression and the pathways interconnecting them gives better knowledge on devising treatment options for the patients. Only studies from Pubmed were included and all other databases were excluded. Studies from the last 50 years were included. Suitable references included in these studies were also extracted. Thus, depression in PD and PD in depression, along with their pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options, have been discussed.",2024-Jan,Cureus,Journal Article; Review,2024,YES,sa,"What makes diagnosing depression in Parkinson's disease patients particularly challenging, and why is it often overlooked?","Significant overlap in clinical features such as bradykinesia, fatigue, and apathy complicates differentiation, and depression may precede PD or vary throughout its course.","The abstract highlights overlapping symptoms between PD and depression, limited diagnostic criteria, and variable expression over time, which collectively hinder recognition and treatment."
37704093,The association of comorbid depression with mortality and amputation risk in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia.,"There is increasing evidence that depression is a risk factor for worse outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease. The association of depression in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is not well described, nor is the impact of medical treatment for depression in this patient population. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depression in patients with CLTI, its association on major amputation and all-cause mortality, and whether medical antidepressant treatment is associated with improvement in these outcomes in patients with depression. A retrospective review of all adult patients (≥18 years old) diagnosed with CLTI from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2018, at a single academic medical center was performed. Collected data included patient demographics, comorbidities, and diagnosis of depression within 6 months of initial CLTI diagnosis. We also collected data on use of antidepressant medications. Outcomes evaluated were need for major lower extremity amputation and all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the adjusted effects of comorbid depression and antidepressant medication use on major amputation and all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrated the probabilities of survival and limb salvage over time, stratified by diagnosis of comorbid depression. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models estimated the adjusted effects of comorbid depression on time to major amputation and all-cause mortality, and the adjusted effect of antidepressant treatment on time to all-cause mortality. A total of 2987 patients with CLTI were identified. Mean age was 68.6 years (standard deviation, 12.9 years); 56.5% were male, and 43.5% were female. Comorbid depression within 6 months of CLTI diagnosis was present in 7.1% of the cohort (212 patients). In multivariable analysis, comorbid depression was associated with a 68% increase in the odds of major amputation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.37; P < .01), a 164% increase in the odds of all-cause mortality among patients not taking antidepressants (aOR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.31-5.32; P = .03), and only a 6% increase in the odds of all-cause mortality among patients taking antidepressants (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72-1.55; P = .99). The effect of comorbid depression on mortality varied significantly by whether or not the patient was taking an antidepressant medication (P = .02). Comorbid depression in the patient population with CLTI is associated with a worse prognosis for major lower extremity amputation overall, and a worse prognosis for all-cause mortality among patients not taking an antidepressant. Furthermore, antidepressant treatment in the presence of comorbid depression in this patient population is associated with an improvement in the odds of all-cause mortality, illustrating the potential importance of medical management of depression.",2024-Jan,Journal of vascular surgery,Journal Article,2024,YES,sa,"In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and comorbid depression, how does antidepressant treatment impact all-cause mortality compared to those not receiving antidepressants?",Antidepressant treatment reduces the odds of all-cause mortality in CLTI patients with comorbid depression compared to those not treated.,"The abstract states that comorbid depression increases all-cause mortality odds by 164% in untreated patients but only by 6% in those on antidepressants, highlighting the benefit of treatment."

This prompted us to ask whether other Skp2 inhibitors could also have an antidepressant effect. Here, we used NSC689857, another Skp2 inhibitor, to investigate this hypothesis. The results showed that administration of NSC689857 (5 mg/kg) produced an antidepressant-like effect in a time-dependent manner in non-stressed male mice, which started 8 days after drug administration. Dose-dependent analysis showed that administration of 5 and 10 mg/kg, but not 1 mg/kg, of NSC689857 produced antidepressant-like effects in both non-stressed male and female mice. Administration of NSC689857 (5 mg/kg) also induced antidepressant-like effects in non-stressed male mice when administered three times within 24 h (24, 5, and 1 h before testing) but not when administered acutely (1 h before testing). In addition, NSC689857 and fluoxetine coadministration produced additive antidepressant-like effects in non-stressed male mice.

38432470,History of mood and anxiety disorders affects return to work and return to sports after rotator cuff repair.,"After rotator cuff repair (RCR), return to work and return to sports is affected by various psychosocial factors. The role of one of these factors - mood and anxiety disorders (MAD) - is still not clear. The primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of prior MAD on the return to work and return to sports after RCR. Our hypothesis was that patients with a history of MAD would take longer to return to work and to sports after RCR, and the rate of return would be lower, than for patients without MAD. This was a retrospective single-center study of patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR (distal supraspinatus tear). Patients who were employed and those who participated in sports before the surgery were included in the ""working"" and ""sports"" groups, respectively. The primary outcomes were the time to return to work and return to sports after surgery. The secondary outcomes were the ratio of patients returning to work and to sports at 3, 6 and 12 months; rate of return to same level of sports; need to change or stop working or sports. The effects of prior MAD on these various outcomes were determined using Bayesian multivariate analysis. The ""working"" group consisted of 158 patients (of which 16.5% had MAD) and the ""sports"" group consisted of 118 patients (of which 17.8% had MAD). In those with a history of MAD, return to work was 21±11 weeks later and the return to sports was 17±8 weeks later than in those without MAD. There was a 98% probability that return to work or return to sports was delayed by at least 4 weeks in patients with history of MAD. The likelihood that patients with prior MAD who undergo RCR will completely abandon their sport was 2.8 times higher (OR=2.8 [1; 7.8]).

This research aims to assess and correlate the hyoid bone position, airway dimensions, and psychological status in class II Hz (horizontal) and Vt (vertical) malocclusion cases with TMD in contrast to non-TMD class I cases. Methodology This research was carried out at the Orthodontics Department, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Sawangi, with consent obtained from the ethical committee. A total of 63 adult patients with class I, class II horizontal, and class II vertical malocclusions were selected. TMD was diagnosed using the Helkimo index, and patients were categorized accordingly. Psychological status was evaluated using the Warwick-Edinburgh scale, while the placement of hyoid bone and airway dimensions were assessed using lateral cephalograms. Statistical analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS version 27.0, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results The research showed a noteworthy difference in the hyoid bone's location, airway dimensions, and psychological status among the three groups. Class II TMD patients (both vertical and horizontal) exhibited higher hyoid bone positions and larger Go-Hy-Me angles (angle formed by the gonion-hyoid line and the hyoid-menton line) compared to class I patients. In addition, class II vertical TMD patients showed the most reduced airway dimensions. Psychological assessments indicated higher stress, anxiety, and depression levels in class II TMD patients, particularly in the vertical group, compared to class I non-TMD patients. Conclusion This study highlights the intricate relationships between hyoid bone position, airway dimensions, and psychological status in TMD patients. TMD patients present with hyoid bones positioned closer to the cranium and mandible, larger Go-Hy-Me angles, and reduced airway dimensions.

We applied ML to the data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to predict the onset of anxiety disorders approximately three years in the future. We used Shapley value-based methods to determine the top factor for prediction. We also investigated whether anxiety onset can be predicted by baseline depression-related predictors alone. Our model was able to predict anxiety onset accurately (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve or AUC = 0.814 ± 0.016 (mean ± standard deviation), balanced accuracy = 0.741 ± 0.016, sensitivity = 0.743 ± 0.033, and specificity = 0.738 ± 0.010). The top predictive factors included prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis, high frailty, anxious personality, and low emotional stability. Depression and mood disorders are well known comorbidity of anxiety; however a prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis could not predict anxiety onset without other factors. While our findings underscore the importance of a prior depression diagnosis in predicting anxiety, they also highlight that it alone is inadequate, signifying the necessity to incorporate additional predictors for improved prediction accuracy. Our study showcases promising prospects for using machine learning to develop personalized prediction models for anxiety onset in middle-aged and older adults using easy-to-access survey data.",2024-Jul-15,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2024,YES,sa,What are the top predictive factors for the onset of anxiety disorders in middle-aged and older adults?,"Prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis, high frailty, anxious personality, and low emotional stability.","The abstract identifies these factors as the most significant predictors for anxiety onset, derived through Shapley value-based methods in a machine learning model analyzing survey data."
39400653,Aromatherapy Using Lavender Oil Effectiveness on Pain and Anxiety After C-Section: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Managing postoperative setting, regarding pain and anxiety after cesarean delivery is crucial for the mother's recovery, her emotional well-being, mother-infant bonding and initiating breastfeeding. Although some research have suggested that aromatherapy with lavender essential oil can be effective in reducing pain and anxiety in various medical settings, the efficacy of lavender aromatherapy in the postoperative setting after cesarean delivery is less well-studied. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of lavender essential oil therapy in the management of pain and anxiety after cesarean delivery. This was a monocentric randomized controlled double-blind trial conducted over a period of five months during 2023. A hundred women undergoing c-sections under spinal anesthesia were enrolled and randomly assigned; using block randomization of 4 items per block with allocation ratio 1:1, into two groups: The aromatherapy group (receiving inhaled Lavender essential oil) versus the placebo group (receiving distilled water instead). The primary outcomes were pain (at rest and after mobilization) and anxiety levels and after the intervention. This trial was registered on clinical-trials.org (NCT06387849). A total of 100 women were included (50 women in each group aromatherapy and the placebo group). The two groups were comparable regarding baseline characteristics and pre-intervention parameters with no statistically significant difference. After the intervention, the pain at rest (38,76 ± 22,9 vs. 23,84 ± 18,01; p < 0.001), the pain after mobilization (60,28 ± 23,72 vs. 40,12 ± 22,18; p < 0.001), and degree of anxiety (46,76 ± 6,59 vs. 44,3 ± 5,17; p = 0.03) were all significantly lower in the aromatherapy group. No adverse effects were reported by participants in both groups.

38294127,"Lifetime adversity predicts depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in a nationally representative sample of older adults in the United States.","Although life stress and adversity are well-known risk factors for mental health problems and cognitive impairment among older adults, limited research has comprehensively examined the impact of both childhood and adulthood adversity on psychiatric and cognitive impairment symptoms over a prolonged period. To address this issue, we investigated how lifetime adversity exposure is related to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of older adults in the United States. We analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2016). The sample included 3496 individuals (59.9% female), aged ≥64 years old (M<sub>age</sub> = 76.0 ± 7.6 years in 2016). We used the individual-level panel data and ordinary least squares regressions to estimate associations between childhood and adulthood adversities, and later-life depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. Many participants experienced a significant early life (38%) or adulthood (79%) stressor. Moreover, experiencing one childhood adversity (vs. none) was associated with a 17.4% increased risk of adulthood adversity. Finally, as hypothesized, childhood adversity exposure was related to experiencing more depression and anxiety symptoms in later life, whereas adulthood stressor exposure predicted more cognitive impairment as well as more depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings demonstrate significant associations between lifetime adversity and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in older adults. Screening for lifetime stressors may thus help healthcare professionals and policymakers identify individuals who could potentially benefit from interventions designed to reduce stress and enhance resilience.",2024-May,Journal of clinical psychology,Journal Article,2024,YES,sa,How might childhood adversity indirectly contribute to an increased likelihood of depression and anxiety symptoms in later life?,"Childhood adversity indirectly contributes by increasing the risk of adulthood adversity, which is associated with more depression and anxiety symptoms.","The abstract states that childhood adversity raises the likelihood of adulthood adversity by 17.4%, and adulthood adversity is linked to higher depression and anxiety symptoms, establishing an indirect pathway."
38600984,The impact of grandparenting on mental health among rural middle-aged and older adults in China: exploring the role of children's support.,"In the rural regions of China, characterized by a pronounced aging demographic and limited resources, a substantial proportion of middle-aged and older adults engage in grandparenting roles. Yet, the literature lacks consistent evidence regarding the effects of grandparenting on the mental health of this cohort. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the impact of grandparenting on the mental health of rural middle-aged and older adults, as well as the underlying mechanisms. This analysis encompassed 10,881 middle-aged and older adults, utilizing data from the 2018 Harmonized China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The mental health of participants was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression-10 (CESD-10) scale, while support from children was categorized into financial and emotional types. The study employed logistic and OLS regression models to identify the mediating role of child support and utilized the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) method for decomposing this mediating effect. The findings demonstrated that grandparenting had a significant negative impact on depression among rural middle-aged and older adults. Furthermore, children's support played a vital role in mediating this relationship, accounting for approximately one-third of the overall influence. Moreover, the decomposition analysis revealed that both emotional and economic support from adult children equally contributed to the declination of depression among rural middle-aged and older adults. Grandparenting significantly enhances mental well-being in rural middle-aged and older adults, with the support from adult children serving as a vital pathway for this positive impact. Both economic and emotional assistance from children hold equal importance in this dynamic. It underscores the necessity of fortifying the family support system to amplify the support provided by children, which in turn could significantly enhance the mental health of rural middle-aged and older adults.",2024,Frontiers in psychiatry,Journal Article,2024,YES,sa,What mediating factors explain the relationship between grandparenting and reduced depression in rural middle-aged and older adults?,"Emotional and economic support from adult children equally mediate the relationship, accounting for one-third of the overall impact.","The abstract identifies grandparenting as reducing depression, with emotional and financial support from children serving as key mediators, equally contributing to this effect."
39438912,Genetic polymorphism involved in major depressive disorder: a systemic review and meta-analysis.,"Genetic polymorphism studies in families and twins indicated the heritability of depression. However, the association between genes with genetic polymorphism and depression provides various findings and remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the genes with their polymorphism associated with the symptomatic depression known as major depressive disorder (MDD). PubMed and Scopus were searched for relevant studies published before May 22, 2023 (1968-2023), and 62 were selected for this review. The study's bias risk was investigated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Gene functional enrichment analysis was investigated for molecular function (MF) and biological process (BP) and pathways. A meta-analysis of the studied genes that were replicative in the same single nucleotide polymorphism was conducted using a random-effect model. The 49 genes involved in MDD were studied and engaged in several pathways, such as tryptophan metabolism or dopaminergic and serotonergic synapses. Based on gene overlapping in MF and BP, 13 genes with polymorphisms were identified as related to MDD. Most of them were only studied once. Solute carrier family 6 member 4 (SLC6A4) overlapping between MF and BP and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as unique to BP were replicative studied and used in the meta-analysis. The polymorphism of SLC6A4 SS and LS genotypes increased the occurrence of MDD development but not significantly [odd ratio (OR) = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-2.22; P = 0.16 and OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 0.84-1.53; P = 0.42, respectively]. A similar result was observed for BDNF rs6265 GG (OR = 1.26; 95% CI = 0.78-2.06; P = 0.35) and BDNF rs6265 AA genotypes (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.77-1.64; P = 0.56). These studies indicated low bias and significant heterogeneity. At least 13 studied genes with polymorphisms were involved in MDD development according to MF and BP, but not significantly. These results suggest that MDD development risk factors might require genetic and other factors for interaction and induction.",2024-Oct-22,BMC psychiatry,"Journal Article; Systematic Review; Meta-Analysis; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2024,YES,sa,"Which two genes with polymorphisms have been most frequently studied for their association with major depressive disorder (MDD), and what biological processes are they linked to?","SLC6A4 and BDNF; SLC6A4 overlaps molecular function and biological processes, while BDNF is unique to biological processes.","The abstract identifies SLC6A4 and BDNF as the most replicatively studied genes for MDD.

A multiple regression model was used to analyze student data from 3 years of enrollment at M University in Fujian Province. Different mental health problems have a significant impact on academic performance, which varies by gender, enrollment year, and subject. Somatization, anxiety, and depression have a significant negative impact on both comprehensive and single-subject scores, while anxiety, social aggression, and other variables can increase academic performance in certain settings. Some effects are notably moderated by gender and enrollment year. University officials should strengthen mental health surveillance and intervention during the first few years of student enrollment to mitigate the harmful impact of mental health issues on academic performance. The moderate to strong effect sizes for variables like somatization, depression, and anxiety indicate that early interventions could be crucial in reducing their negative impact on both short-and long-term academic outcomes. Furthermore, the study discovered disparities in mental health and academic performance across students of different genders and enrollment years, emphasizing that educational personnel should design more tailored mental health support methods that consider these differences.",2024,Frontiers in public health,Journal Article,2024,YES,sa,How might early interventions for clinical anxiety disorders influence both short-term and long-term academic performance in university freshmen?,"Early interventions can mitigate anxiety's negative impact on academic performance and, in certain settings, enhance performance through improved coping mechanisms.",The abstract states that anxiety negatively affects academic performance but can also increase it in specific contexts.

38564872,Meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of benzodiazepines and antidepressants for psychic versus somatic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.,"Benzodiazepines and antidepressants are effective agents for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), with the HAM-A frequently used as a primary outcome measure. The GAD literature is inconsistent regarding which medications are more effective for somatic versus psychic symptoms of GAD, and treatment guidelines do not advocate for prescribing based on subtype. This meta-analysis aimed to determine whether benzodiazepines and antidepressants have a differential impact on the somatic versus psychic subscales of the HAM-A in GAD. An electronic search was undertaken for randomized controlled trials of either benzodiazepines or antidepressants for GAD that reported treatment response using the HAM-A subscales. Data were extracted by independent reviewers. A random effects assessment of weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals and subgroup difference was applied. All analysis was done on SPSS 26. An assessment of bias, and of quality of evidence was performed. 24 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria: 18 antidepressant trials, 5 benzodiazepine trials and 1 of both. 14 studies were assessed as having between some and high risk of bias, while 10 were assessed as having low risk of bias. Benzodiazepines (WMD of 1.81 [CI 1.03, 2.58]) were significantly more effective than antidepressants (WMD of 0.83 [CI 0.64, 1.02]) for reducing somatic symptoms of GAD (Chi<sup>2</sup> = 5.81, p = 0.02), and were also more effective (WMD of 2.46 [CI 1.83, 3.09]) in reducing psychic symptoms than antidepressants (WMD of 1.83 [CI 1.55, 2.10]), although this comparison did not reach statistical significance (Chi<sup>2</sup> = 3.31, p = 0.07).

Recent research has reported that AIBDs lead to psychosocial impairment, including depression and anxiety. Missing from the extant literature is an examination of the impact of AIBDs on body image and related psychological constructs. The current study seeks to characterize the psychological and social consequences of AIBD diagnosis, with particular attention to body image dissatisfaction. We conducted a survey study of adults with AIBDs. The survey was open from February 2023 to March 2023. Validated self-report questionnaires assessed depressive symptomatology, body image disturbance and quality of life. Demographic information and self-reported psychiatric history before and after AIBD diagnosis were collected via self-report. Participants were 451 adults with AIBDs, recruited through the International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation newsletters, email distribution lists and social media. Participants reported increased incidence of psychiatric disorders following AIBD diagnosis. Participants reported high levels of depressive symptomatology and impairments to quality of life compared to other patient groups. The sample reported extremely high levels of body image disturbance, more so than other patients with disfiguring diseases or injury. Correlation analyses revealed significant relationships between body image variables and quality of life, even after controlling for depression.

In this study, we examine differences in current smoking among Asian Americans from two different ethnic backgrounds before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data (n=202) from Chinese and South Asian adults in Chicago, collected between February and May 2020. We conducted logistic regression models to estimate the relationship between exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic and current smoking. We tested whether the association varied by Asian American ethnic group, unemployment, racial discrimination, and depression symptoms. We found that current smoking increased from 28% to 48% among Asian Americans (i.e. Chinese and South Asians) during the pandemic. We found a statistically significant interaction between the COVID-19 period indicator variable and current smoking by Asian American ethnic groups (p=0.014), such that current smoking was lower for Chinese compared to South Asians before COVID-19, but was comparable for both groups during the pandemic. We also found a statistically significant interaction between the period indicator variable and current smoking by racial discrimination (p=0.047) and depression symptoms (p=0.02). Results from these interactions suggest that Asian Americans who experienced racial discrimination and depression during the pandemic may be more likely to be current smokers compared to their pre-pandemic counterparts. The findings of the study highlight the need for culturally tailored smoking cessation interventions for Asian American communities that address pandemic-related stressors such as discrimination that may trigger cigarette use.",2024,Tobacco induced diseases,Journal Article,2024,YES,sa,How might racial discrimination and depression symptoms during a public health crisis influence smoking behavior in Asian American populations?,Racial discrimination and depression symptoms during a crisis increase smoking likelihood in Asian Americans due to heightened distress.,"The abstract indicates racial discrimination and depression are significantly associated with increased smoking during the pandemic, highlighting stress as a trigger for cigarette use."
38300752,The feasibility and impact of a brief behavioural intervention for anxiety in later life: perceptions of general practice nurses.,"Anxiety is prevalent in older people and is associated with adverse health outcomes. Early detection and intervention are imperative, yet clinically significant anxiety in older people is often under-diagnosed. When diagnosed, pharmacotherapy is often the initial treatment, but resistance due to stigma, polypharmacy concerns, and side effects are common among the elderly. Non-pharmacological interventions such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation may offer more acceptable and cost-effective options to managing anxiety. While primary care is ideal for addressing anxiety in older adults, it is important to assess the feasibility and acceptability of nurse-led interventions in general practice. To explore the perspectives of General Practice Nurses (GPNs) on the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a guided relaxation intervention for older people living with symptoms of anxiety, in Australian metropolitan and regional settings. GPNs were trained and then administered a guided relaxation intervention to older people at three metropolitan general practices and one large rural practice encompassing four sites. Subsequently, five GPNs participated in semi-structured interviews exploring the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the intervention. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and findings were mapped to four key domains of interest: ""Screening"", ""Training and Delivery"", ""Perceived impact of the Intervention"" and ""Barriers to the intervention"". Overall, GPNs reported that the intervention was easy to implement, was well received, helped build relationships and enabled conversations about mental health and well-being.

38470426,"Exploring the interplay of frailty, physical function, physical activity, nutritional status, and their association with quality of life and depressive symptoms in older adults with the frailty phenotype.","This study aimed to explore the interplay between frailty, physical function, physical activity, nutritional status, and their impact on the quality of life and depressive status in older adults with frailty. A cross-sectional study involving 235 pre-frail/frail older adults residing in Spanish communities was conducted. Frailty was assessed using Fried's criteria, physical function was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery, and physical activity levels were measured via wrist-worn accelerometers. Nutritional status was determined using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment alongside anthropometric measurements. Quality of life was gauged using the EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level, while depressive status was assessed using the Yesavage 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. Multivariate linear regression and logistic regression analyses were employed to elucidate the associations of these factors with quality of life and depression. Our findings revealed significant correlations between various factors and quality of life. Notably, reported fatigue (β = -0.276, p = 0.002), performance in the 4-m gait test (β = -0.242, p = 0.001), the score on the short version of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (β = 0.312, p = 0.002), and engagement in light physical activity (β = 0.180, p = 0.023) were all found to be associated with quality of life. In terms of depressive symptoms, the Mini-Nutritional Assessment score emerged as a protective factor (Odds ratio, OR: 0.812, p < 0.001), as did participation in moderate physical activity (OR: 0.988, p = 0.028). Conversely, fatigue (OR: 3.277, p = 0.003) and a slow gait speed (OR: 1.136, p = 0.045) were identified as risk factors for depressive symptoms.

39221779,[The efficacy of magnetic transcranial stimulation in treating treatment-resistant or prolonged depression in a clinical sample].,"Depression is a common, serious and often chronic disorder and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The annual prevalence of depression is 5-10%, twice as high among women as men and the lifetime prevalence is at least 20%. Up to a third of depressed individuals meet criteria for treatment-resistant depression, where two antidepressants have been tried for at least 6 weeks each at therapeutic doses. As of January 2022 transcranial magnetic stimulation for adults with treatment-resistant depression that has not responded to other forms of treatment has been available by a service that is part of Primary Health Care of the Capital Area in Iceland. This is a retrospective cohort study where participants completed a course of magnetic transcranial treatment for depression in the years 2022 and 2023. Two validated self-rating measures were used to assess depression. Information on previous treatment approaches for depression was collected from electronic health records. 104 individuals completed the treatment in these first two years, 60,6% women. Most had unipolar depression (86,5%), but a small subgroup had bipolar depression (13,5%). The proportion of responders varied according to the measures used, 36,1% and 45,7%, respectively, and the same was true for remission where the proportions were 12,4% and 31,5%, respectively, higher for the longer inventory. The drop-out rate was only 12,5% and no serious adverse events were reported during the treatment.

38441216,Emotional Blunting in Depression in the PREDDICT Clinical Trial: Inflammation-Stratified Augmentation of Vortioxetine With Celecoxib.,"Emotional symptoms are recognized as a key feature in individuals with major depressive disorder. Previously, emotional blunting has been described both as a side effect of antidepressant treatment and as a symptom of depression. Little is known about the change of emotional blunting during antidepressant treatment. The PREDDICT trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 6-week trial on the augmentation of vortioxetine with the anti-inflammatory agent celecoxib or placebo. Presently we report on exploratory secondary outcomes of changes in emotional blunting in depression assessed with the Oxford Depression Questionnaire (ODQ) total score and subscores from baseline to 8-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up assessments. In the whole group, there was a significant improvement in the ODQ total score and all subscores after 8 weeks. After stratification of participants into the treatment groups, the ODQ total score as well as subscores related to emotional blunting as a symptom of depression (reduction in positive emotions, not caring) improved between baseline and all follow-up time points in both treatment groups. Changes in subscores considered as a side effect of antidepressants (general reduction in emotions, emotional detachment) were inconclusive in both treatment groups. Overall, the placebo-augmented group showed slightly better results in changes of emotional blunting scores than the celecoxib group as did those with elevated inflammation at screening, regardless of treatment group. This analysis suggests favorable effects of vortioxetine on emotional blunting in both short- and long-term course. The beneficial impact of vortioxetine on emotional blunting was weaker in celecoxib-augmented patients compared with placebo, possibly due to pharmacokinetic interactions.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 823 pregnant women in Thai Binh, Vietnam. The women were screened for GDM and structured questionnaire were used to collect data on social support factors, GDM factors, and symptoms of depression. The diagnosis of GDM was based on the 2-hour 75-g OGTT according to WHO 2013 criteria. The Edinburg Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cut-off of 10 and the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MSPSS) were used to assess depression symptoms and perceived social support, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to measure the associations between social support, GDM-related factors, and symptoms of depression. The relationship between social support score and symptoms of depression was evaluated using Spearman's correlation. The strength of the associations were measured by adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The prevalence rates of GDM and symptoms of depression were 22.2% (95%CI: 19.4-25.2) and 23.0% (95%CI: 20.1-26.0), respectively.

38723742,Downregulation of lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A/LSD1) in medial prefrontal cortex facilitates chronic stress-induced pain and emotional dysfunction in female mice.,"Chronic primary pain, characterized by overlapping symptoms of chronic pain, anxiety, and depression, is strongly associated with stress and is particularly prevalent among females. Recent research has convincingly linked epigenetic modifications in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to chronic pain and chronic stress. However, our understanding of the role of histone demethylation in the mPFC in chronic stress-induced pain remains limited. In this study, we investigated the function of lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A/LSD1) in the context of chronic overlapping pain comorbid with anxiety and depression in female mice. We employed a chronic variable stress model to induce pain hypersensitivity in the face and hindpaws, as well as anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, in female mice. Our findings revealed that chronic stress led to a downregulation of KDM1A mRNA and protein expression in the mPFC. Notably, overexpressing KDM1A in the mPFC alleviated the pain hypersensitivity, anxiety-like behaviors, and depression-like behaviors in female mice, without affecting basal pain responses or inducing emotional distress. Conversely, conditional knockout of KDM1A in the mPFC exacerbated pain sensitivity and emotional distress specifically in females. In summary, this study highlights the crucial role of KDM1A in the mPFC in modulating chronic stress-induced overlapping pain, anxiety, and depression in females.

38965868,Curcumin and nano-curcumin applications in psychiatric disorders.,"Psychiatric disorders cause long-lasting disabilities across different age groups. While various medications are available for mental disorders, some patients do not fully benefit from them or experience treatment resistance. The pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders involves multiple mechanisms, including an increase in the inflammatory response. Targeting inflammatory mechanisms has shown promise as a therapeutic approach for these disorders. Curcumin, known for its anti-inflammatory properties and potential neuroprotective effects, has been the subject of studies investigating its potential as a treatment option for psychiatric disorders. This review comprehensively examines the potential therapeutic role of curcumin and its nanoformulations in psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders. There is lack of robust clinical trials across all the studied psychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. More studies have focused on MDD. Studies on depression indicate that curcumin may be effective as an antidepressant agent, either alone or as an adjunct therapy. However, inconsistencies exist among study findings, highlighting the need for further research with improved blinding, optimized dosages, and treatment durations. Limited evidence supports the use of curcumin for bipolar disorder, making its therapeutic application challenging.

39029662,Depression increases the risk of gallstone: A cross-sectional study and Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Gallstone, a common digestive disorder, poses a significant public health burden. Concurrently, depression is acknowledged as a health risk. However, limited information exists on depression's impact on gallstone formation. This study investigates depression's causal effect on gallstone risk. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we conducted an observational study. The severity of depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression and subgroup analyses explored the correlation between depression and gallstone risk. Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis, leveraging Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data, reduced observational bias and elucidated causality. Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW) was the primary method, with sensitivity analyses validating results. In the observational study (7707 participants), gallstone risk was elevated in mild (OR: 1.58, 95 % CI 1.31-1.90, P < 0.001), moderate (OR: 2.07, 95 % CI 1.59-2.67, P < 0.001), and severe (OR: 2.41, 95 % CI 1.70-3.34, P < 0.001) depression groups (P for trend <0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed a stronger association in those under 65, females, non-Hispanic Black, individuals with obesity, smokers, and those with college education or higher. Mendelian Randomization indicated a causal link between genetically predicted depression and higher cholelithiasis risk (OR: 2.06, 95 % CI 1.34-3.17, P = 0.001), validated through sensitivity analyses and multi-cohort verification. Depression independently increases gallstone risk, particularly in those under 65, females, non-Hispanic Black, individuals with obesity, smokers, and those with college education or higher. Further validation is needed through multi-center, prospective cohort studies.",2024-Oct-01,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article; Observational Study,2024,YES,sa,What demographic and clinical factors are associated with a stronger link between depression and gallstone risk?,"Age under 65, female gender, non-Hispanic Black ethnicity, obesity, smoking, and higher education (college or more).","The abstract identifies these factors as subgroups where depression shows a stronger association with gallstone risk, based on observational and subgroup analyses."
26189199,"Supraphysiological hormonal status, anxiety disorders, and COMT Val/Val genotype are associated with reduced sensorimotor gating in women.","Pregnancy is a period characterized by a supraphysiological hormonal status, and greater anxiety proneness, which can lead to peripartum affective symptoms with dramatic consequences not only for the woman but also for the child. Clinical psychiatry is heavily hampered by the paucity of objective and biology-based intermediate phenotypes. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, a neurophysiological measure of sensorimotor gating, has been poorly investigated in relation to anxiety and in pregnant women. In the present study, the PPI of healthy non-pregnant women (n = 82) and late pregnant women (n = 217) was investigated. Age, BMI, depression and anxiety symptoms, tobacco use, and antidepressant medication were considered. We investigated and provided evidence of lower PPI: (i) in healthy pregnant women compared to healthy non-pregnant controls, (ii) in pregnant women with anxiety disorders compared to healthy pregnant women, (iii) in pregnant women with anxiety disorders using SSRI compared to un-medicated pregnant women with anxiety disorders, and (iv) in healthy pregnant women carrying the COMT Val158Met Val/Val genotype compared to Met carriers. Altogether, a reduced sensorimotor gating as an effect of supraphysiological hormonal status, anxiety disorders, SSRIs, and catecholaminergic genotype, implicate the putative relevance of lower PPI as an objective biological correlate of anxiety proneness in pregnant women. These findings call for prospective studies to dissect the multifactorial influences on PPI in relation to mental health of pregnant women.",2015-Oct,Psychoneuroendocrinology,,2015,YES,sa,"What neurophysiological measure is reduced in pregnant women with anxiety disorders, and how might SSRI use further impact this measure?","Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is reduced in pregnant women with anxiety disorders, and SSRI use is associated with an additional reduction in PPI.","The abstract identifies reduced PPI in pregnant women with anxiety disorders and notes further reduction in those using SSRIs, highlighting its potential as a biological correlate of anxiety proneness in pregnancy."

26441696,Psychosocial adjustment to ALS: a longitudinal study.,"For the current study the Lazarian stress-coping theory and the appendant model of psychosocial adjustment to chronic illness and disabilities (Pakenham, 1999) has shaped the foundation for identifying determinants of adjustment to ALS. We aimed to investigate the evolution of psychosocial adjustment to ALS and to determine its long-term predictors. A longitudinal study design with four measurement time points was therefore, used to assess patients' quality of life, depression, and stress-coping model related aspects, such as illness characteristics, social support, cognitive appraisals, and coping strategies during a period of 2 years. Regression analyses revealed that 55% of the variance of severity of depressive symptoms and 47% of the variance in quality of life at T2 was accounted for by all the T1 predictor variables taken together. On the level of individual contributions, protective buffering, and appraisal of own coping potential accounted for a significant percentage in the variance in severity of depressive symptoms, whereas problem management coping strategies explained variance in quality of life scores. Illness characteristics at T2 did not explain any variance of both adjustment outcomes. Overall, the pattern of the longitudinal results indicated stable depressive symptoms and quality of life indices reflecting a successful adjustment to the disease across four measurement time points during a period of about two years. Empirical evidence is provided for the predictive value of social support, cognitive appraisals, and coping strategies, but not illness parameters such as severity and duration for adaptation to ALS. The current study contributes to a better conceptualization of adjustment, allowing us to provide evidence-based support beyond medical and physical intervention for people with ALS.",2015,Frontiers in psychology,,2015,YES,sa,What psychosocial factors are predictive of the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with ALS over time?,Protective buffering and appraisal of own coping potential.,"The abstract identifies protective buffering and appraisal of own coping potential as significant predictors of depressive symptom severity, highlighting their role in psychosocial adjustment to ALS over time."

Assessment of sexual function was a secondary objective. Outpatients (≥ 18 years) who met criteria for MDD from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision and had screening and baseline 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS17) total scores ≥ 20 were randomly assigned to placebo or desvenlafaxine 50 or 100 mg/d in an 8-week study conducted from October 2011 to August 2012. The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline in HDRS17 total score at week 8, analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Sexual function was assessed using the Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX). The safety population included 909 patients (intent-to-treat population, n = 886). Significantly greater improvement in adjusted mean HDRS17 total score from baseline to week 8 was observed for desvenlafaxine 50 mg (-11.28; P = .006) and desvenlafaxine 100 mg (-11.67; P < .001) compared with placebo (-9.71), with adjustment for multiplicity. In the ASEX total score analysis (n = 422), the treatment by gender interaction was not significant; thus, genders were combined for subsequent analyses. Comparisons for desvenlafaxine versus placebo for change from baseline in ASEX total and all item scores found P > .05, with no adjustment for multiplicity. Rates of sexual dysfunction based on ASEX were comparable among treatment groups. These results support previous findings demonstrating antidepressant efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d versus placebo.

25932464,Facilitating emotional processing in depression: the application of exposure principles.,"Even with the best psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for unipolar depression, relapse is a serious problem. One path to improve treatments for depression is to target fundamental processes that go awry in depression and to enhance new learning by adapting principles and strategies from exposure-based treatments for anxiety and fear-related disorders. I describe basic principles of exposure and emotional processing and illustrate with Exposure-Based Cognitive Therapy (EBCT) for depression, how these principles can be applied, with some adaptation, to address the therapeutic targets of depression. Clinical trial data of EBCT suggest that this application might be fruitful and that the process of change might be similar to that in exposure-based treatments for anxiety and trauma-related disorders.",2015-Aug-01,Current opinion in psychology,,2015,YES,sa,What therapeutic approach adapts exposure principles to target fundamental processes in unipolar depression and how does it aim to reduce relapse?,"Exposure-Based Cognitive Therapy (EBCT); it enhances emotional processing and new learning, addressing core processes that contribute to depression.","The abstract describes EBCT as adapting exposure principles to target fundamental processes in depression, promoting emotional processing and new learning to mitigate relapse, similar to its use in anxiety and trauma-related disorders."
26253824,Sexual Victimization and Somatic Complaints in Pregnancy: Examination of Depression as a Mediator.,"Research suggests that women with histories of sexual victimization are more likely to experience somatic complaints in pregnancy. However, prior studies have been limited by homogenous samples, have primarily only examined the relationship of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) to somatic complaints, and have not examined potential mechanisms explaining this association. Thus, the current study examined the relationship between lifetime sexual victimization history and somatic complaints in pregnancy in an ethnically diverse sample of pregnant women. Additionally, depressive symptoms were examined as a mediator of the sexual victimization-somatic complaints relationship. Women were recruited from the waiting room of a university-affiliated obstetrics-gynecology clinic to complete a study of psychological health and negative sexual experiences. The 407 currently pregnant participants who completed measures of their sexual victimization history, depressive symptoms, and somatic complaints were primarily African American (53.6%), low to middle income (75.4%), and reported an unplanned pregnancy (72%). A total of 27.7% of women had a history of CSA and/or adolescent/adult sexual assault. Mediation analyses using bootstrapping supported depression as a significant mediator of the relationship between sexual victimization and somatic complaints, with a medium-sized effect (κ(2) = .09). Having a history of sexual victimization is associated with risk for poor mental and physical health during pregnancy. There are likely multiple mechanisms explaining the association between sexual victimization and somatic complaints in pregnancy, which should be investigated in future research.",2015,Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health,,2015,YES,sa,What psychological factor mediates the relationship between a history of sexual victimization and somatic complaints during pregnancy?,Depressive symptoms.,"The abstract identifies depressive symptoms as a significant mediator with a medium-sized effect, explaining the association between a history of sexual victimization and somatic complaints in pregnant women."

A prospective longitudinal study with four repeated measurements. Ninety relatives of patients with severe brain injury. The relatives were assessed on the anxiety and depression scales from the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and latent variable growth curve models were used to model the trajectories. The effects of patient's age, patient's Glasgow Coma Score, level of function and consciousness, gender and relationship of the relatives were modelled. Improvement was found in both symptoms of anxiety and depression during the 12-month study period. The analysis revealed different trajectories for symptoms of anxiety and depression, as anxiety had a more rapid improvement. Higher initial level of symptoms of depression was seen in female relatives. Higher initial level of anxiety was associated with younger patient age, lower level of function and consciousness in the patient and the relative being female or the spouse. Future research and interventions should focus not only on specific deficits in the patient, but also on how the emotional state and well-being of the relatives evolve, while trying to adjust and cope with a new life-situation.",2015,Brain injury,,2015,YES,sa,What factors are associated with higher initial levels of anxiety in relatives of patients with severe brain injury?,"Younger patient age, lower patient function and consciousness, female gender of the relative, and being the patient's spouse.",The abstract identifies these factors as predictors of higher initial anxiety levels in relatives coping with severe brain injury in patients.
25955598,Methylation of the tryptophan hydroxylase‑2 gene is associated with mRNA expression in patients with major depression with suicide attempts.,"Tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) contributes to alterations in the function of neuronal serotonin (5-HT), which are associated with various psychopathologies, including major depressive disorder (MDD) or suicidal behavior. The methylation of a single CpG site in the promoter region of TPH2 affects gene expression. Suicide and MDD are strongly associated and genetic factors are at least partially responsible for the variability in suicide risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether variations in TPH2 methylation in peripheral blood samples may predispose patients with MDD to suicide attempts. TPH2 mRNA expression levels differed significantly between 50 patients with MDD who had attempted suicide (MDD + suicide group) and 75 control patients with MDD (MDD group); TPH2 expression levels were significantly decreased (P=0.0005) in the patients who had attempted suicide. Furthermore, the frequency of TPH2 methylation was 36.0% in the MDD + suicide group, while it was 13.0% in the MDD group. The results of the present study demonstrated that methylation in the promoter region of TPH2 significantly affected the mRNA expression levels of TPH2, thus suggesting that methylation of the TPH2 promoter may silence TPH2 mRNA expression in MDD patients with or without suicidal behavior. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the methylation status of the TPH2 promoter and depression, hopelessness and cognitive impairment in the MDD + suicide group. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that TPH2 expression was regulated by DNA methylation of the TPH2 promoter region in patients with MDD.",2015-Aug,Molecular medicine reports,,2015,YES,sa,How might TPH2 promoter methylation influence the risk of suicide attempts in patients with major depressive disorder?,"TPH2 promoter methylation reduces TPH2 mRNA expression, which correlates with increased suicide risk in MDD patients.","The abstract indicates that TPH2 methylation silences mRNA expression.

26459844,"Gradients of Fear Potentiated Startle During Generalization, Extinction, and Extinction Recall--and Their Relations With Worry.","It is well established that fear conditioning plays a role in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Moreover, abnormalities in fear generalization, extinction, and extinction recall have also been associated with anxiety. The present study used a generalization paradigm to examine fear processing during phases of generalization, extinction, and extinction recall. Specifically, participants were shocked following a CS+ and were also presented with stimuli that ranged in perceptual similarity to the CS+ (i.e., 20%, 40%, or 60% smaller or larger than the CS+) during a fear generalization phase. Participants were also presented with the same stimuli during an extinction phase and an extinction recall phase 1week later; no shocks were presented during extinction or recall. Lastly, participants completed self-report measures of worry and trait anxiety. Results indicated that fear potentiated startle (FPS) to the CS+ and GS±20% shapes was present in generalization and extinction, suggesting that fear generalization persisted into extinction. FPS to the CS+ was also evident 1 week later during extinction recall. Higher levels of worry were associated with greater FPS to the CS+ during generalization and extinction phases. Moreover, individuals high in worry had fear response gradients that were steeper during both generalization and extinction. This suggests that high levels of worry are associated with greater discriminative fear conditioning to threatening compared to safe stimuli and less fear generalization to perceptually similar stimuli.",2015-Sep,Behavior therapy,,2015,YES,sa,How might high levels of worry impact fear generalization and discriminative fear conditioning in individuals with anxiety disorders?,High worry is linked to greater discriminative fear conditioning to threatening stimuli and less fear generalization to similar stimuli.,"The abstract shows that high worry correlates with steeper fear response gradients during generalization and extinction phases, indicating reduced generalization and heightened discrimination between threatening and safe stimuli."
26644958,Comparison Between the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self and the Beck Depression Inventory II in Primary Care.,"The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self (MADRS-S) and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) are commonly used self-assessment instruments for screening and diagnosis of depression. The BDI-II has 21 items and the MADRS-S has 9 items. These instruments have been tested with psychiatric inpatients but not in outpatient primary care, where most patients with symptoms of depression initially seek treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare these 2 instruments in the primary care setting. Data were collected from 2 primary care randomized controlled trials that were performed from 2010 to 2013 in Sweden: the Primary Care Self-Assessment MADRS-S Study and Primary Care Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Study. There were 146 patients (73 patients each from both trials) who had newly diagnosed mild or moderate depression (per DSM-IV recommendations) and who had assessment with both the MADRS-S and BDI-II at primary care centers. Comparability and reliability of the instruments were estimated by Pearson product moment correlation and Cronbach α. A good correlation was observed between the 2 instruments: 0.66 and 0.62 in the 2 study cohorts. The reliability within the 2 study cohorts was good for both MADRS-S (Cronbach α: 0.76 for both cohorts) and BDI-II items (Cronbach α: 0.88 and 0.85).

26141847,Anxiogenic drug administration and elevated plus-maze exposure in rats activate populations of relaxin-3 neurons in the nucleus incertus and serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus.,"Anxiety is a complex and adaptive emotional state controlled by a distributed and interconnected network of brain regions, and disruption of these networks is thought to give rise to the behavioral symptoms associated with anxiety disorders in humans. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), which contains the majority of forebrain-projecting serotonergic neurons, is implicated in the control of anxiety states and anxiety-related behavior via neuromodulatory effects on these networks. Relaxin-3 is the native neuropeptide ligand for the Gi/o-protein-coupled receptor, RXFP3, and is primarily expressed in the nucleus incertus (NI), a tegmental region immediately caudal to the DR. RXFP3 activation has been shown to modulate anxiety-related behavior in rodents, and RXFP3 mRNA is expressed in the DR. In this study, we examined the response of relaxin-3-containing neurons in the NI and serotonergic neurons in the DR following pharmacologically induced anxiety and exposure to an aversive environment. We administered the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 or vehicle to adult male Wistar rats and, 30 min later, exposed them to either the elevated plus-maze or home cage control conditions. Immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos was used to determine activation of serotonergic neurons in the DR and relaxin-3 neurons in the NI, measured 2h following drug injection. Analysis revealed that FG-7142 administration and exposure to the elevated plus-maze are both associated with an increase in c-Fos expression in relaxin-3-containing neurons in the NI and in serotonergic neurons in dorsal and ventrolateral regions of the DR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that relaxin-3 systems in the NI and serotonin systems in the DR interact to form part of a network involved in the control of anxiety-related behavior.",2015-Sep-10,Neuroscience,,2015,YES,sa,"Which two brain regions are implicated in modulating anxiety-related behavior through neuromodulatory effects, and what neurochemical systems are primarily involved?",The nucleus incertus (NI) with relaxin-3 and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) with serotonin.,"The abstract identifies relaxin-3 in the NI and serotonin in the DR as key systems interacting to control anxiety-related behavior, with both regions showing increased c-Fos activation under anxiogenic conditions."
25389986,Victimization exposure and suicidal ideation among Spaniard adolescents evaluated at outpatient mental health services.,"Suicidal ideation among adolescents has been associated with victimization in various studies; however, the nature of this association is not clear. Our aim was to examine the influence of victimization exposure on suicidal ideation in a clinical sample of adolescents. Eleven to 17-year-old subjects were recruited from Child and Adolescent Outpatient Psychiatric Services. They completed the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview, the Stressful Life Events Scale, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, the Children's Depression Inventory, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Family APGAR. Demographic data, developmental features, medical and psychiatric history, family history, and treatment histories were also evaluated. A backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of victimization exposure on suicidal ideation controlling for potential confounding variables. Two hundred and thirty-nine adolescents (62.3% male; mean age 14.31 years, SD=1.9) took part in this investigation. Of these, 20.9% reported victimization exposure. Adolescents who experienced peer victimization and/or were victims of a crime were significantly more likely to report suicidal ideation (χ2=10.05, df=1, p=0.002). However, suicidal ideation was only predicted by emotional and behavioral problems (χ2=4.79, df=1, p=0.029), depressive sympthomatology (χ2=3.17, df=1, p=0.075), and number of total stressful life events (χ2=4.02, df=1, p=0.045). Behavioral and emotional problems, as well as the accumulation of stressful life events may have a direct relation to suicidal ideation among adolescents evaluated at Child and Adolescent Mental Health Outpatient Services.

After adjustment for sex, age, socioeconomic status, and type of employment contract, present or recent psychiatric disorders other than depression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74-0.83), cancer (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.47-0.92), diabetes (HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.62-0.86), cardiovascular disease (HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.62-0.99), hypertension (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.67-0.85), musculoskeletal disorders (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.77-0.87), and asthma (HR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.94) were all associated with a lower likelihood of returning to work compared with depression episodes without other conditions. Among employees with depression-related absence, return to work is delayed in the presence of other psychiatric and somatic conditions. These findings suggest that other diseases should be taken into account when evaluating the outcome of depression-related absence.

26205468,Effect of religiosity/spirituality and sense of coherence on depression within a rural population in Greece: the Spili III project.,"Recent research has addressed the hypothesis that religiosity/spirituality and sense of coherence buffer the negative effects of stress on numerous health issues. The aim of the current study was to further this work by exploring potential links between psycho-social factors such as religiosity/spirituality and sense of coherence with depression. A total number of 220 subjects of the SPILI III cohort (1988-2012) attending a primary care setting in the town of Spili on rural Crete represented the target group. All participants underwent a standardized procedure. Validated questionnaires were used to evaluate sense of coherence, depression levels and religious and spiritual beliefs. A multiple linear regression analysis of the Beck Depression Inventory Scale (BDI) in relation to demographic characteristics, scores on the Royal Free Interview for Spiritual and Religious Beliefs scale (RFI-SRB) and Sense of Coherence scale (SOC) was performed. A significant inverse association was found between BDI and RFI-SRB scale (B-coef = -0.6999, p < 0.001), as well as among BDI and SOC scale (B-coef = -0.556, p < 0.001). The findings of the current observational study indicate that highly religious participants are less likely to score high in the depression scale. Furthermore, participants with high SOC scored significantly lower in the BDI scale.

26202341,Longitudinal relationship of diabetes-related distress and depressive symptoms: analysing incidence and persistence.,"To investigate the longitudinal bi-directionality of diabetes-related distress and depressive symptoms. A total of 509 patients receiving intensified insulin therapy completed the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale questionnaire for the assessment of depressive symptoms as well as the Problem Areas in Diabetes questionnaire for the assessment of diabetes-related distress at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Separate logistic and linear regression analyses for incidence and persistence were performed with demographic (age, gender, BMI) and medical (diabetes type, HbA1c , diabetes duration, late complications) control variables. Diabetes-related distress at baseline increased the risk of the incidence of elevated depressive symptoms by 2.56-fold (odds ratio 2.56; 95% CI 1.15-5.72; P = 0.02) when controlling for demographic and medical variables. In addition, diabetes-related distress at baseline doubled the chance of the persistence of elevated depressive symptoms (odds ratio 2.04, 95% CI 1.04-3.99; P = 0.04) when controlling for demographic and medical variables. The chance of having persistent elevated diabetes-related distress was increased 5.94-fold (odds ratio 5.94, 95% CI 2.60-13.59; P < 0.0001) when elevated depressive symptoms were present at baseline. None of the medical variables had an influence on incidence or persistence. Diabetes-related distress was identified as a risk factor for the incidence and persistence of depressive symptoms. Reducing diabetes-related distress could help to prevent the development of elevated depressive symptoms. Furthermore, depressive symptoms were identified as an amplifier for diabetes-related distress. Diabetes-related distress and depressive symptoms were independent risk factors for each other and should be monitored in routine care to disentangle their influence.",2015-Oct,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,,2015,YES,sa,How might diabetes-related distress influence the persistence of depressive symptoms in patients undergoing intensified insulin therapy?,"Diabetes-related distress doubles the likelihood of persistent depressive symptoms, with an odds ratio of 2.04 when controlling for demographic and medical factors.","The abstract highlights that diabetes-related distress is a risk factor for both the incidence and persistence of depressive symptoms, independent of medical variables like HbA1c or diabetes complications."

Inflammatory processes are involved in the pathogenesis of both brucellosis and depression. Therefore, we hypothesized that celecoxib could be beneficial for the treatment of depression due to brucellosis. Forty outpatients with depression due to brucellosis with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (HDRS) <19 participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and underwent 8 weeks of treatment with either celecoxib (200 mg bid) or placebo as an adjunctive to antibiotic therapy.

26674863,Sex Differences in Nucleus Accumbens Transcriptome Profiles Associated with Susceptibility versus Resilience to Subchronic Variable Stress.,"Depression and anxiety disorders are more prevalent in females, but the majority of research in animal models, the first step in finding new treatments, has focused predominantly on males. Here we report that exposure to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) induces depression-associated behaviors in female mice, whereas males are resilient as they do not develop these behavioral abnormalities. In concert with these different behavioral responses, transcriptional analysis of nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, by use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed markedly different patterns of stress regulation of gene expression between the sexes. Among the genes displaying sex differences was DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), which shows a greater induction in females after SCVS. Interestingly, Dnmt3a expression levels were increased in the NAc of depressed humans, an effect seen in both males and females. Local overexpression of Dnmt3a in NAc rendered male mice more susceptible to SCVS, whereas Dnmt3a knock-out in this region rendered females more resilient, directly implicating this gene in stress responses. Associated with this enhanced resilience of female mice upon NAc knock-out of Dnmt3a was a partial shift of the NAc female transcriptome toward the male pattern after SCVS. These data indicate that males and females undergo different patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to stress and that a DNA methyltransferase in NAc contributes to sex differences in stress vulnerability. Women have a higher incidence of depression than men. However, preclinical models, the first step in developing new diagnostics and therapeutics, have been performed mainly on male subjects. Using a stress-based animal model of depression that causes behavioral effects in females but not males, we demonstrate a sex-specific transcriptional profile in brain reward circuitry. This transcriptional profile can be altered by removal of an epigenetic mechanism, which normally suppresses DNA transcription, creating a hybrid male/female transcriptional pattern. Removal of this epigenetic mechanism also induces behavioral resilience to stress in females. These findings shed new light onto molecular factors controlling sex differences in stress response.",2015-Dec-16,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,,2015,YES,sa,What role does DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play in sex differences in stress vulnerability related to depression?,Dnmt3a in the NAc increases stress susceptibility in females and resilience in males by regulating sex-specific transcriptional responses to stress.,"The abstract shows Dnmt3a is more induced in females after stress, and altering its expression modifies behavioral responses and transcriptional patterns, highlighting its role in sex-specific stress vulnerability."
25698121,[Collaborative and stepped care for depression: Development of a model project within the Hamburg Network for Mental Health (psychenet.de)].,"Depression is one of the most widespread mental disorders in Germany and causes a great suffering and involves high costs. Guidelines recommend stepped and interdisciplinary collaborative care models for the treatment of depression. Stepped and collaborative care models are described regarding their efficacy and cost-effectiveness. A current model project within the Hamburg Network for Mental Health exemplifies how guideline-based stepped diagnostics and treatment incorporating innovative low-intensity interventions are implemented by a large network of health care professionals and clinics. An accompanying evaluation using a cluster randomized controlled design assesses depressive symptom reduction and cost-effectiveness for patients treated within ""Health Network Depression"" (""Gesundheitsnetz Depression"", a subproject of psychenet.de) compared with patients treated in routine care. Over 90 partners from inpatient and outpatient treatment have been successfully involved in recruiting over 600 patients within the stepped care model. Communication in the network was greatly facilitated by the use of an innovative online tool for the supply and reservation of treatment capacities. The participating professionals profit from the improved infrastructure and the implementation of advanced training and quality circle work.

26446699,Investigation of body image as a mediator of the effects of bowel and GI symptoms on psychological distress in female survivors of rectal and anal cancer.,"Treatment for rectal and anal cancer (RACa) can result in persistent bowel and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Body image problems may develop over time and exacerbate symptom-related distress. RACa survivors are an understudied group, however, and factors contributing to post-treatment well-being are not well understood. This study examined whether poorer body image explained the relation between symptom severity and psychological distress. Participants (N = 70) completed the baseline assessment of a sexual health intervention study. Bootstrap methods tested body image as a mediator between bowel and GI symptom severity and two indicators of psychological distress (depressive and anxiety symptoms), controlling for relevant covariates. Measures included the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-CR38) Diarrhea, GI Symptoms, and Body Image subscales and Brief Symptom Index Depression and Anxiety subscales. Women averaged 55 years old (SD = 11.6), White (79 %), and were 4 years post-treatment. Greater Depression was related to poorer Body Image (r = -.61) and worse Diarrhea (r = .35) and GI Symptoms (r = .48). Greater Anxiety was related to poorer Body Image (r = -.42) and worse GI Symptoms (r = .45), but not Diarrhea (r = .20). Body Image mediated the effects of bowel and GI symptoms on Depression, but not on Anxiety. Long-term bowel and GI dysfunction are distressing and affect how women perceive and relate to their bodies, exacerbating survivorship difficulties. Interventions to improve adjustment post-treatment should address treatment side effects, but also target body image problems to alleviate depressive symptoms. Reducing anxiety may require other strategies. Body image may be a key modifiable factor to improve well-being in this understudied population. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm findings.",2016-Apr,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,,2015,YES,sa,How might body image disturbances mediate the relationship between gastrointestinal symptoms and depressive symptoms in rectal and anal cancer survivors?,"Body image disturbances exacerbate the psychological distress caused by persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, contributing to depressive symptoms.","The abstract identifies body image as a mediator between gastrointestinal symptoms and depression, suggesting that distress related to body image amplifies the psychological impact of physical symptoms, particularly depression."
25953359,Functional Uncoupling NMDAR NR2A Subunit from PSD-95 in the Prefrontal Cortex: Effects on Behavioral Dysfunction and Parvalbumin Loss after Early-Life Stress.,"Exposure to early-life stress increases vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety. Growing evidence implicates aberrant development of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the effects of early-life stress, which often emerge in adolescence or young adulthood. Specifically, early-life stress in the form of maternal separation (MS) in rodents has been shown to decrease parvalbumin (PVB)-positive interneurons in the adolescent PFC; however, the mechanism underpinning behavioral dysfunction and PVB loss is not yet known. We recently reported that MS causes overexpression of the NMDA subunit NR2A in the PFC of adolescent rats. Elevated PFC NR2A is also found in developmental models of schizophrenia and is correlated with behavioral deficits, acting largely through its association with the postsynaptic protein PSD-95. In addition, adolescent maturation of PVB-positive interneurons relies on NR2A-driven NMDA activity. Therefore, it is possible that the NR2A/PSD-95 signaling complex has a role in adolescent MS effects. Here, we aimed to determine whether a discrete manipulation of PFC NR2A could prevent MS effects on PFC-controlled behaviors, including cognition, anxiety, and novelty-induced hyperlocomotion, as well as PVB loss in adolescence. We intracranially infused the NR2A-specific blocking peptide TAT2A in order to uncouple NR2A from PSD-95 in the early-adolescent PFC, without antagonizing the NMDA receptor. We demonstrated that MS rats treated with TAT2A during early adolescence were protected from MS-induced PVB loss and exhibited less anxious behavior than those infused with control peptide. These data implicate NR2A-related N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor development in adolescent behavioral and neural consequences of early-life stress.",2015-Nov,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,,2015,YES,sa,"How might early-life stress specifically affect the development of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, and what intervention could mitigate this effect to reduce anxiety symptoms?",Early-life stress reduces parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the prefrontal cortex via NR2A/PSD-95 signaling.

25794285,Prediction of long-term treatment response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) using scalp and source loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) analysis in patients with major depressive disorder.,"Animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) is inversely related to central serotonergic activity, with a high LDAEP reflecting weak serotonergic neurotransmission and vice versa, though the findings in humans have been less consistent. In addition, a high pretreatment LDAEP appears to predict a favorable response to antidepressant treatments that augment the actions of serotonin. The aim of this study was to test whether the baseline LDAEP is correlated with response to long-term maintenance treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Scalp N1, P2 and N1/P2 LDAEP and standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography-localized N1, P2, and N1/P2 LDAEP were evaluated in 41 MDD patients before and after they received antidepressant treatment (escitalopram (n = 32, 10.0 ± 4.0 mg/day), sertraline (n = 7, 78.6 ± 26.7 mg/day), and paroxetine controlled-release formulation (n = 2, 18.8 ± 8.8 mg/day)) for more than 12 weeks. A treatment response was defined as a reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score of >50% between baseline and follow-up. The responders had higher baseline scalp P2 and N1/P2 LDAEP than nonresponders (p = 0.017; p = 0.036). In addition, changes in total BDI score between baseline and follow-up were larger in subjects with a high baseline N1/P2 LDAEP than those with a low baseline N1/P2 LDAEP (p = 0.009). There were significantly more responders in the high-LDAEP group than in the low-LDAEP group (p = 0.041).

25510198,The effects of different basal levels of anxiety on the behavioral shift analyzed in the central platform of the elevated plus maze.,"The aim of the present research was to study the effects of different basal levels of anxiety on the behavioral shift studied in the central platform of the elevated plus maze. To this purpose, quantitative and multivariate analyses, the latter based on transition matrix elaboration, were carried out on Wistar and on DA/Han rats the latter belonging to a strain characterized by different reactivity to anxiogenic stimuli. Wistar rats spent 74.11±5.11 s in the central platform, whereas DA/Han significantly more: 127.08±9.87. Per cent distributions evidenced a clear-cut difference in walking activities (46.25% in Wistar, 28.4% in DA/Han rats) and in the sniffing activities (45.82% in Wistar, 62.54% in DA/Han). Mean frequencies of each behavioral element showed in DA/Han strain a value significantly lower than in Wistar for central-platform entry, open arm-entry and closed-arm entry and a significant higher value for central- platform sniffing, open-arm sniffing and corner-rearing. Moreover, the ratio open-arm entry/open-arm sniffing and closed-arm entry/closed-arm-sniffing showed significant higher values in the Wistar strain. Finally, by means of hierarchical clustering analysis, strong differences between the two strains were observed in the behavioral architecture: a cascade-shaped dendrogram, branching from Walking activities, indicates that Wistar rat behavior is oriented to cross the central platform so to rapidly reach an arm; on the contrary, the dendrogram of DA/Han rats displays a behavior heavily oriented toward the permanence in the central platform. The results show that different basal levels of anxiety provoke significant differences in the behavioral shift studied in the central platform of the elevated plus maze. Such differences, evidenced by means of transition matrices elaboration, might represent the behavioral expression of anxiety-induced modifications of decision making process underlying behavioral shift activities.",2015-Mar-15,Behavioural brain research,,2015,YES,sa,How might baseline anxiety levels influence decision-making processes in exploratory behavior within an elevated plus maze?,"Higher baseline anxiety levels are associated with prolonged central platform permanence and increased sniffing, suggesting altered decision-making prioritizing safety over exploration.","The abstract shows DA/Han rats, with higher anxiety, spent more time sniffing and in the central platform, indicating anxiety-induced changes in decision-making during exploratory tasks."
26221567,Frozen moments: flashback memories of critical incidents in emergency personnel.,"Emergency Department personnel regularly face highly stressful situations or critical incidents (CIs) that may subsequently be recalled as unbidden intrusive memories. In their most extreme form, such memories are reexperienced as if they were happening again in the present, as flashbacks. This study examined (1) which CIs are associated with flashback memories; (2) candidate person and work-related features that predict flashback memories; and (3) the association between flashback memories and anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. Emergency nurses (N = 91; 80.2% female) were recruited from two urban teaching hospitals and filled in self-report questionnaires. A majority (n = 59, 65%) experienced intrusive memories; almost half of the sample reported that their memories had flashback character. Those involved in resuscitations in the past week were at a fourfold risk for experiencing flashbacks. Having worked more consecutive days without taking time off was associated with a somewhat lower incidence of flashbacks. Moreover, older individuals who reported more work-related conflicts were at greater risk for experiencing flashback memories than their younger colleagues with heightened work conflict and flashback memory scores, respectively.

25928892,Dissociation of learned helplessness and fear conditioning in mice: a mouse model of depression.,"The state of being helpless is regarded as a central aspect of depression, and therefore the learned helplessness paradigm in rodents is commonly used as an animal model of depression. The term 'learned helplessness' refers to a deficit in escaping from an aversive situation after an animal is exposed to uncontrollable stress specifically, with a control/comparison group having been exposed to an equivalent amount of controllable stress. A key feature of learned helplessness is the transferability of helplessness to different situations, a phenomenon called 'trans-situationality'. However, most studies in mice use learned helplessness protocols in which training and testing occur in the same environment and with the same type of stressor. Consequently, failures to escape may reflect conditioned fear of a particular environment, not a general change of the helpless state of an animal. For mice, there is no established learned helplessness protocol that includes the trans-situationality feature. Here we describe a simple and reliable learned helplessness protocol for mice, in which training and testing are carried out in different environments and with different types of stressors. We show that with our protocol approximately 50% of mice develop learned helplessness that is not attributable to fear conditioning.",2015,PloS one,,2015,YES,sa,What experimental feature distinguishes learned helplessness from conditioned fear in animal models of depression?,"Trans-situationality, where helplessness transfers to different environments and stressors.","The abstract highlights trans-situationality as a key feature of learned helplessness, distinguishing it from conditioned fear, which is tied to specific environments or stressors."

We review the evidence concerning attention and treatment outcomes in anxiety disorders. The evidence reviewed here suggests that that attention biases assessed at pre-treatment might actually predict improved response to treatment, and in particular that prolonged engagement with threat as measured in tasks such as the dot probe is associated with greater reductions in anxious symptoms following treatment. We examine this research within a fear learning framework, considering the possible role of individual differences in attention in the extinction of fear during exposure. Theoretical, experimental and clinical implications are discussed, particularly with reference to the potential for attention bias modification programs in augmenting treatment, and also with reference to how existing research in this area might inform best practice for clinicians.",2015,Frontiers in psychology,,2015,YES,sa,"What specific attentional bias, when assessed prior to treatment, has been associated with greater reductions in anxiety symptoms following exposure therapy?",Prolonged engagement with threat.,"The abstract states that prolonged engagement with threat, as assessed through tasks like the dot probe, is linked to greater reductions in anxiety symptoms post-treatment, suggesting its role in predicting improved treatment outcomes."
26071623,Neural correlates of anxiety sensitivity in panic disorder: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study.,"Panic disorder has been associated with dysfunctional neuropsychological dimensions, including anxiety sensitivity. Brain-imaging studies of the neural correlates of emotional processing have identified a network of structures that constitute the neural circuitry for emotions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and insula, which are part of this network, are also involved in the processing of threat-related stimuli. The aim of the study was to investigate if neural activity in response to emotional stimuli in the cortico-limbic network is associated to anxiety sensitivity in panic disorder. In a sample of 18 outpatients with panic disorder, we studied neural correlates of implicit emotional processing of facial affect expressions with a face-matching paradigm; correlational analyses were performed between brain activations and anxiety sensitivity. The correlational analyses performed showed a positive correlation between anxiety sensitivity and brain activity during emotional processing in regions encompassing the PFC, ACC and insula. Our data seem to confirm that anxiety sensitivity is an important component of panic disorder. Accordingly, the neural underpinnings of anxiety sensitivity could be an interesting focus for treatment and further research.",2015-Aug-30,Psychiatry research,,2015,YES,sa,"Which brain regions demonstrate increased activity during emotional processing in individuals with panic disorder, and how is this activity related to anxiety sensitivity?","The prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula show increased activity, which positively correlates with anxiety sensitivity.","The abstract identifies the PFC, ACC, and insula as part of the emotional processing network, with their activity during emotional stimuli positively correlating with anxiety sensitivity in panic disorder."
26347585,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Studies of Postpartum Depression: An Overview.,"Postpartum depression is a frequent and disabling condition whose pathophysiology is still unclear. In recent years, the study of the neural correlates of mental disorders has been increasingly approached using magnetic resonance techniques. In this review we synthesize the results from studies on postpartum depression in the context of structural, functional, and spectroscopic magnetic resonance studies of major depression as a whole. Compared to the relative wealth of data available for major depression, magnetic resonance studies of postpartum depression are limited in number and design. A systematic literature search yielded only eleven studies conducted on about one hundred mothers with postpartum depression overall. Brain magnetic resonance findings in postpartum depression appear to replicate those obtained in major depression, with minor deviations that are not sufficient to delineate a distinct neurobiological profile for this condition, due to the small samples used and the lack of direct comparisons with subjects with major depression. However, it seems reasonable to expect that studies conducted in larger populations, and using a larger variety of brain magnetic resonance techniques than has been done so far, might allow for the identification of neuroimaging signatures for postpartum depression.",2015,Behavioural neurology,,2015,YES,sa,What is a key limitation in identifying distinct neurobiological profiles for postpartum depression compared to major depression using magnetic resonance studies?,Small sample sizes and lack of direct comparisons with major depression hinder identification of distinct neurobiological profiles for postpartum depression.,"The abstract highlights that studies on postpartum depression involve limited sample sizes and insufficient direct comparisons with major depression, preventing clear neuroimaging signatures for postpartum depression."
25717350,The monoaminergic footprint of depression and psychosis in dementia with Lewy bodies compared to Alzheimer's disease.,"Depression and psychosis are two of the most severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both NPS have negative effects on cognitive performance and life expectancy. The current study aimed to investigate and compare monoaminergic etiologies between both neurodegenerative conditions, given the lack of an efficient pharmacological treatment until present. Eleven behaviorally relevant brain regions of the left frozen hemisphere of 10 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with/without depression (AD + D/-D; 5 were psychotic within AD + D), 10 confirmed DLB patients, all of whom were depressed (DLB + D; 5 psychotic patients), and, finally, 10 confirmed control subjects were regionally dissected. All patients were retrospectively assessed before death using the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (Behave-AD) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia amongst others. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), (nor)adrenaline and respective metabolites, i.e. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), were determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. DLB subjects had the overall lowest monoamine and metabolite concentrations regarding 33 out of 41 significant monoaminergic group alterations. Moreover, MHPG levels were significantly decreased in almost 8 out of 11 brain regions of DLB- compared to AD patients. We also observed the lowest 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, and 5-HIAA/5-HT turnover ratios in DLB + D compared to AD + D subjects. Additionally, a 4- and 7-fold increase of DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA turnover ratios, and, a 10-fold decrease of thalamic DA levels in DLB + D compared to AD + D patients and control subjects was noticed. Regarding psychosis, hippocampal DA levels in the overall DLB group significantly correlated with Behave-AD AB scores. In the total AD group, DA levels and HVA/DA ratios in the amygdala significantly correlated with Behave-AD AB scores instead. Monoaminergic neurotransmitter alterations contribute differently to the pathophysiology of depression and psychosis in DLB as opposed to AD, with a severely decreased serotonergic neurotransmission as the main monoaminergic etiology of depression in DLB. Similarly, psychosis in DLB might, in part, be etiologically explained by dopaminergic alterations in the hippocampus, whereas in AD, the amygdala might be involved.",2015,Alzheimer's research & therapy,,2015,YES,sa,"In patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and clinical depression, which neurotransmitter system shows the most significant alterations compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with depression?",The serotonergic system shows the most significant alterations in DLB patients with depression compared to AD patients with depression.,"The abstract highlights severely decreased serotonergic neurotransmission as the primary monoaminergic etiology of depression in DLB, distinguishing it from AD-related depression, which involves different neurotransmitter dynamics."
25222880,"Mediating effects of stress, weight-related issues, and depression on suicidality in college students.","Through a holistic health lens, the current study examines the effects of weight-related issues and stress on suicidality while controlling for depressive symptoms in college students. In total, 872 undergraduate and graduate students at DePaul University completed the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment II Web-based survey in Spring 2010. Measures of suicidality, depression, weight-related issues, and life stressors were assessed, along with gender differences. Females reported experiencing more weight loss attempts and total stressors than males. Weight-related issues and stress both significantly predicted depressive symptoms in a path analysis; depressive symptoms, in turn, significantly predicted suicidality. Gender differences were found; depressive symptoms mediate the relation between stress and suicidal behavior for females but not for males. This investigation furthers previous research on suicidality in college students and suggests that all-inclusive interventions that address weight-related issues and stress may help reduce depressive symptoms, which then may reduce suicidal behavior.",2015,Journal of American college health : J of ACH,,2015,YES,sa,How might gender differences influence the mediating role of depressive symptoms in the relationship between stress and suicidality?,Depressive symptoms mediate stress-suicidality for females but not males.,"The abstract states depressive symptoms mediate the stress-suicidality link for females, while this relationship does not hold for males, highlighting gender-specific pathways in suicidality."
11480881,The burden of disease for treatment-resistant depression.,"Assessing the consequences of specific diseases on global, national, and individual levels is complex. The Global Burden of Disease Study was launched in 1992 to develop objective measures of the burden of disease. Two measures have become widely accepted: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) assesses years of life lost due to a disease plus years lived with the disability due to that disease, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is a related measure with greater relevance for diseases that do not routinely produce earlier mortality. When DALYs and YLDs were compared world-wide for 100 disorders, they revealed a huge burden of disease for depression. Indeed, the findings were startling. Neuropsychiatric conditions are by far the world's leader in YLDs, accounting for almost 30%. Unipolar major depressive disorder alone accounted for 11% of global YLDs. The disability of major depressive disorder produces its greatest burden upon women and starts early in life. No separate disability assessments have been compiled for treatment-resistant depression, but of individuals with major depressive disorder, the most severely disabled are those with treatment-resistant depression. The contributions to the morbidity associated with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression include widespread prevalence; relatively early symptom onset; severe underdiagnosis and undertreatment; genetic vulnerabilities and precipitation or accentuation by relatively unavoidable stressors; a longitudinal pattern of frequent recurrences with increasing frequency, severity, and consequences unless treated with maintenance strategies; inadequate prioritization of recurrence prevention among clinicians; and possible suppression of brain neurogenesis, neuronal atrophy, cell death, hippocampal dysfunction, and magnetic resonance imaging changes for those with chronic treatment-resistant depression. Since the patterns of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increasing severity of treatment-resistant depression are key reasons for its high burden, reducing the burden requires an entire paradigm shift, including emphasis on the prevention of recurrences. Only then will this prevalent, disabling yet treatable disorder lose its ignominious status as a world leader in disease burden.",2001,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,2001,YES,sa,"What are two key reasons for the high global burden of treatment-resistant depression, and how could this burden be reduced?",Key reasons: recurrent episodes with increasing severity and inadequate prioritization of recurrence prevention.

11802513,[Differences in the psychological status of hysterectomy and non-hysterectomy women].,"Despite numerous investigations on the well-being of hysterectomized women, this issue is still discussed controversially. The aim of the present study was to reveal differences between a group of hysterectomized women with a fairly long follow-up period (7.9 years) and a group of non-hysterectomized women with respect to their psychological well-being. In a questionnaire study we compared a group of 216 women who underwent hysterectomy with a group of 90 non-hysterectomized women. Dependent variables were: body complaints, psychological well-being, dysphoria, socio-sexual assertiveness, and gender-role orientation. The group of hysterectomized women showed significantly higher levels of body complaints, depression, and unassertiveness in sexual situations, as well as decreased psychological well-being, and a more traditional gender-role orientation. Within the group of hysterectomized women, duration since hysterectomy, surgical techniques, and hormone substitution therapy seem to be unrelated to the psychological variables. The group differences cannot be causally attributed to the hysterectomy, since they may already have existed premorbidly. Nevertheless, the results suggest that a more thorough psychological examination prior to hysterectomy, as well as provision of support for the coping process after intervention is advantageous.",2001-Dec-17,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,"English Abstract; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2001,YES,sa,What psychosocial factors should be assessed preoperatively in women undergoing hysterectomy to minimize risks of post-surgical depression?,"Premorbid psychological well-being, socio-sexual assertiveness, and gender-role orientation.","The abstract indicates premorbid differences in psychological well-being, sexual unassertiveness, and traditional gender-role orientation may influence post-surgical depression risks, suggesting these factors should be assessed preoperatively."
11301922,Management of anxiety disorders: the added challenge of comorbidity.,"Patients with anxiety present with a wide variety of disorders that cause significant impairment to their everyday lives. To complicate matters, patients seldom present with just one anxiety disorder. Such comorbidity, particularly where depression is also present, has important implications for both the patient and the physician. The patient typically suffers from a greater degree of everyday impairment, is more reliant on healthcare services, in particular mental health services, and may be at a greater risk of attempting suicide. For the physician, comorbidity in anxiety disorders presents a challenge as the patient's symptoms are often more severe, present earlier in life, and are frequently prolonged which makes their management more complex. This review will focus on the anxiety disorders: panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impact of co-existing multiple anxiety disorders, depression, or a history of substance abuse will be discussed with a view to choosing the appropriate management strategy. Treatment options will be reviewed.",2001,Depression and anxiety,Journal Article; Review,2001,YES,sa,What are two key factors that complicate the management of patients with comorbid anxiety and depression?,"More severe, prolonged symptoms and earlier onset of symptoms.","The abstract states that comorbidity in anxiety and depression leads to more severe, prolonged symptoms that present earlier in life, making management more complex."
11704076,Extraocular light therapy in winter depression: a double-blind placebo-controlled study.,"It has been hypothesized that the circadian pacemaker is phase delayed in seasonal affective disorder, (SAD) winter type, and that the phase advance resulting from morning ocular light accounts for the efficacy of light therapy. Extraocular light has been reported to produce phase-shifts of the human circadian pacemaker. This allows a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of light therapy in SAD. Twenty-nine SAD patients participated. Clinical state was measured on days 1, 8, and 15 of the protocol. From days 4 through 8, 15 patients (4 M, 11 F) received extraocular light by fiberoptic illumination, and 14 (4 M, 10 F) placebo (no light) in the popliteal fossae, from 8 AM to 11 AM. In the evenings of days 3 and 8, the salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was assessed. Patients completed daily self-ratings on mood, alertness, and sleep. Both conditions showed a progressive improvement of clinical state over time. Between conditions, no significant differences were observed in clinical scores, the self-ratings on mood and alertness, and in timing of the DLMO before and directly after treatment. The response to extraocular light therapy in SAD patients did not exceed its placebo effect. Extraocular light did not induce a phase shift of the circadian pacemaker.",2001-Nov-01,Biological psychiatry,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2001,YES,sa,"What was the observed effect of extraocular light therapy on the circadian pacemaker in patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and how did it compare to placebo?",Extraocular light therapy did not induce a phase shift of the circadian pacemaker and showed no clinical advantage over placebo.,"The study found no significant differences between extraocular light therapy and placebo in clinical improvement, self-ratings, or phase shifts of the circadian pacemaker in SAD patients."
11466749,Secondary prevention of depressive symptoms in elderly inhabitants of residential homes.,"The effects of a multifaceted secondary prevention intervention in residential homes in the Netherlands were examined, using a quasi-experimental design. In five experimental residential homes, the caregivers received three training sessions on detecting depression and on supporting depressed residents. Furthermore, an information session was organized for all personnel, a further session was organized for residents and their relatives, and several group interventions were offered. 213 residents participated in the study. 211 residents of five other residential homes, matched on basic variables, served as a comparison group. Effects on depressive symptoms (geriatric depression scale) and health related quality of life (MOS-SF-36) were measured at pretest and after the intervention, one year later. Because the drop-out rate was high and drop-outs differed significantly from the remaining population, the scores of drop-outs were imputed. Since we used a quasi-experimental design, we controlled for confounding variables. Regression analyses resulted in significant effects of the intervention on the GDS and on role functioning in the total population. When the analyses were limited to those scoring high on the GDS at pretest, significant effects were found on the GDS, and on four domains of health-related quality of life: psychological distress, role functioning, pain and social functioning. The improvement in GDS scores in GDS cases was significantly larger than in other subjects. Our results suggest that general approaches aimed at a residential home are capable of influencing depressive symptoms in inhabitants. Possibly, it may not be necessary to wait until depressive symptoms have escalated and inhabitants need extensive treatment.",2001-Jul,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study,2001,YES,sa,What domains of health-related quality of life showed significant improvement in individuals with elevated pre-intervention depressive symptoms after a multifaceted secondary prevention intervention in residential homes?,"Psychological distress, role functioning, pain, and social functioning.","The abstract states that in residents with high GDS scores at pretest, significant improvements were observed in four domains of health-related quality of life: psychological distress, role functioning, pain, and social functioning, following the intervention."
11270452,Evolutionary approaches to psychopathology: the role of natural defences.,"Psychoanalytic theories of the mind emerged in the immediate post-Darwinian era of the 1880s and 1890s. Since that time much has changed in both psychoanalytic and evolutionary theorizing. This paper explores recent evolutionary thinking on psychopathology. Relevant literature was reviewed. This paper outlines some of the common behavioural defence mechanisms and then explores ways in which they are represented in various disorders, with a focus on depression. This paper suggests that 'symptoms' can be related to the activation of evolved defence mechanisms to respond to losses and threats. Such will involve, for example, anxious arousal and heightened vigilance and attention to the threat, with the type of defence (e.g. fight, flight, submit, help seeking) being mirrored in particular symptom presentations. Defences can become pathological when they are too easily aroused or prolonged, are arrested (aroused but not expressed) and/or ineffective.",2001-Feb,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,2001,YES,sa,How can prolonged activation of evolved defence mechanisms contribute to the pathophysiology of clinical depression?,"Prolonged activation can lead to symptoms like arrested or ineffective defences, resulting in maladaptive responses to losses or threats, characteristic of clinical depression.","The abstract states prolonged or arrested defence mechanisms can become pathological, with depression symptoms reflecting maladaptive responses to threats or losses, such as ineffective fight, flight, or submission behaviours."
11329486,"Serotonergic dysfunction, negative mood states, and response to alcohol.","Dysfunction of central serotonergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis and maintenance of alcoholism. Serotonergic dysfunction may be associated with three behavior patterns relevant for alcoholism: impulsive aggression, negative mood states, and a low response to alcohol intake. We reviewed the literature on the psychopathological correlates of serotonergic dysfunction and focused on studies that assess the interaction between negative mood states and alcohol response. Prospective studies in nonhuman primates that underwent early separation stress found an association between a low serotonin turnover rate and the disposition to excessive alcohol intake and impulsive aggression. These findings seem to be relevant for a subgroup of alcoholics with a low serotonin turnover rate and antisocial personality traits. Cross-sectional data in humans also support a relationship between reduced serotonergic neurotransmission and aggressive behavior and indicate that the association of serotonergic dysfunction and aggression may be mediated by negative mood states. This hypothesis is in accordance with a large body of data linking anxiety and depression to serotonergic dysfunction. In human alcoholics, brain imaging has detected a reduction in serotonin transporter availability in association with depression. Serotonin transporter availability seems to be related to reduced GABA-ergic sedation and the acute response to alcohol intake, an important predictor of subsequent development of alcohol dependence. Several lines of evidence point to a relationship between serotonergic dysfunction, negative mood states, and excessive alcohol intake, which may be mediated in part by reduced alcohol-induced sedation.",2001-Apr,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",Journal Article; Review,2001,YES,sa,"What neurotransmitter dysfunction is implicated in the relationship between clinical depression, aggressive behavior, and alcohol dependence, and how might this dysfunction influence alcohol-induced sedation?",Serotonergic dysfunction; it reduces alcohol-induced sedation.,"The abstract links serotonergic dysfunction to depression, aggression, and alcohol dependence, noting that reduced serotonin transporter availability correlates with diminished alcohol-induced sedation, which predicts alcohol dependence development."
11231831,A randomized trial of relapse prevention of depression in primary care.,"Despite high rates of relapse and recurrence, few primary care patients with recurrent or chronic depression are receiving continuation and maintenance-phase treatment. We hypothesized that a relapse prevention intervention would improve adherence to antidepressant medication and improve depression outcomes in high-risk patients compared with usual primary care. Three hundred eighty-six patients with recurrent major depression or dysthymia who had largely recovered after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment by their primary care physicians were randomized to a relapse prevention program (n = 194) or usual primary care (n = 192). Patients in the intervention group received 2 primary care visits with a depression specialist and 3 telephone visits over a 1-year period aimed at enhancing adherence to antidepressant medication, recognition of prodromal symptoms, monitoring of symptoms, and development of a written relapse prevention plan. Follow-up assessments were completed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months by a telephone survey team blinded to randomization status. Those in the intervention group had significantly greater adherence to adequate dosage of antidepressant medication for 90 days or more within the first and second 6-month periods and were significantly more likely to refill medication prescriptions during the 12-month follow-up compared with usual care controls. Intervention patients had significantly fewer depressive symptoms, but not fewer episodes of relapse/recurrence over the 12-month follow-up period. A relapse prevention program targeted to primary care patients with a high risk of relapse/recurrence who had largely recovered after antidepressant treatment significantly improved antidepressant adherence and depressive symptom outcomes.",2001-Mar,Archives of general psychiatry,"Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2001,YES,sa,What specific intervention components can improve adherence to antidepressant medication in patients with recurrent major depression or dysthymia?,"Primary care visits with a depression specialist, telephone follow-ups, symptom monitoring, prodromal symptom recognition, and a written relapse prevention plan.","The abstract states that these components were part of the relapse prevention intervention, which significantly improved antidepressant adherence and depressive symptom outcomes in high-risk patients."

The outcome of an acute ECT course in 253 patients with nonpsychotic (n = 176) and psychotic (n = 77) unipolar major depression was assessed in the first phase of an ongoing National Institute of Mental Health-supported four-hospital collaborative study of continuation treatments after successful ECT courses. ECT was administered with bilateral electrode placement at 50% above the titrated seizure threshold. The remission criteria were rigorous: a score <or=10 on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) after 2 consecutive treatments, and a decrease of at least 60% from baseline. The overall remission rate was 87% for study completers. Among these, patients with psychotic depression had a remission rate of 95% and those with nonpsychotic depression, 83%. Improvement in symptomatology, measured by the HRSD, was more robust and appeared sooner in the psychotic patients compared with the nonpsychotic patients. Bilateral ECT is effective in relieving severe major depression. Remission rates are higher and occur earlier in psychotic depressed patients than in nonpsychotic depressed patients.

It was expected that social anxiety would be specifically related to low perceived competence in the social domain and threat appraisal in the same domain, whereas depression would be related to more general perceived competence deficits. The relationships of social anxiety and depression to perceived competence and appraisal were largely supported. Social anxiety was most strongly related to perceived social competence as well as to both social cost and likelihood appraisals, whereas depression was more generally related to perceived competence, and appraisal of negative events did not improve the prediction of depression any more than the prediction based on perceived competence.",2001-Apr,Journal of adolescence,Journal Article,2001,YES,sa,How do perceived competence deficits differ in their relationship to social anxiety versus depression in adolescents?,"Social anxiety is linked to low perceived social competence, while depression is associated with general perceived competence deficits.","The abstract specifies that social anxiety is strongly related to perceived social competence, whereas depression is broadly related to perceived competence across various domains, not limited to the social sphere."
11459397,"Perceptions of illness causation among new referrals to a community mental health team: ""explanatory model"" or ""exploratory map""?","The health beliefs of people suffering from mental health problems are important. Such beliefs have been identified as key factors in models of health and illness behaviour, and may therefore indirectly influence clinical outcome. In addition, the increasing move towards patient-centred health care suggests that such beliefs need to be identified if a patient's perspective of his or her illness is to be addressed in the care process. Past research on health beliefs surrounding depression have concentrated on identifying ""explanatory models"" among the general community or among people who already have an established diagnosis of depression. This paper describes the content and status of health beliefs among people who are in the process of receiving a diagnosis. In-depth interviews were carried out with new referrals to a community mental health team (CMHT). Individuals expressed a variety of perceived causes throughout the interview. Beliefs were therefore characterised as changeable. It is argued that the concept of an ""explanatory model"" is too fixed to fully convey the fluid status of beliefs among this patient group. The concept of an ""exploratory map"" is suggested as a replacement. Such maps outline the avenues of thought which individuals explored when attempting to understand why they were currently experiencing particular psychological problems.

11211292,Couple functioning in depression: the roles of sociotropy and autonomy.,"We evaluated the hypothesis that interpersonal relationships of depressed persons would vary as a function of the personality variables sociotropy and autonomy. Depressed psychiatric patients who reported being in a current intimate relationship for at least six months were administered measures of sociotropy, autonomy, and several aspects of relationship functioning. Results indicated that sociotropy was related significantly to patients' reporting their own behavior as demanding and their partners' behavior as withdrawing, whereas autonomy was related to patients' reporting their partners' behavior as demanding and their own behavior as withdrawing. Autonomy also was related to greater relationship dissatisfaction, and there was a trend for autonomy to be related to greater criticism of the partner.

11200959,The prevalence of depression in relation to cerebral atrophy and cognitive performance in 70- and 74-year-old women in Gothenburg. The Women's Health Study.,"Hospital-based studies report that depression in the elderly is associated with brain atrophy. This notion could not be confirmed in a population study on 85-year-olds. We aimed to assess depression in relation to brain atrophy and cognition in 70- and 74-year-old women. METHODS; A representative sample of 70- and 74-year-old women (N = 501) was examined with a psychiatric examination including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), measuring global cognitive function, and computerized tomography (CT) of the brain (N = 268). Depression was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R. Previous depression was diagnosed by history and by information from previous examinations in this 24-year longitudinal study. The prevalence of depression was 11.6%, including 8.4% with major depression (MDD). Among those who were currently mentally healthy, 43.0% had a history of previous depression. Women with current MDD had lower scores on the MMSE than the mentally healthy women. This association was only found in women with a lower level of education. Current depressives, previous depressives and mentally healthy women without a history of depression did not differ on CT with regard to brain atrophy or white matter lesions. The association between MDD and lower cognitive performance was independent of the association of cognitive performance with structural brain changes on CT. Brain atrophy on CT is not associated with depression in the general population, despite the fact that individuals with depression have a worse cognitive performance.

11281519,Extended continuation and maintenance ECT for long-lasting episodes of major depression.,"While most major depressive episodes are relatively short lasting, a substantial minority of patients with severe mood disorders respond poorly to available treatments and remain ill for extended periods of time. The possible role of continuation and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the management of such patients has not been clearly established. Three patients are reported whose long-lasting, relatively medication refractory episodes of major depression were treated with ECT for both acute and continuation and maintenance purposes. Although relapses occurred despite treatment, the frequency, severity, and duration of relapses were apparently diminished by ECT. Relapses occurred with diminishing frequency over the course of individual episodes, and were typically reversed by three or four closely spaced ECT treatments. No medical complications occurred. While complaints of memory difficulty were common, Mini-Mental Status Examinations 6 weeks after ECT were unimpaired. Continuation and maintenance ECT appears to be a safe and effective treatment modality for long-lasting episodes of major depression. Recommendations for clinical management are proposed.",2001-Mar,The journal of ECT,Case Reports; Journal Article,2001,YES,sa,"What is a potential benefit of continuation and maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with long-lasting, treatment-resistant major depressive episodes?","It may reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of relapses over time.","The abstract states that continuation and maintenance ECT diminished the frequency, severity, and duration of relapses in patients with long-lasting, medication-refractory major depressive episodes."
11459334,A model for handling missing items on two depression rating scales.,"A problem in clinical trials for antidepressants is that patient rating scales are not always completed properly. If one or more items are missing, a patient evaluation may be prevented from contributing towards an efficacy analysis. This can be very wasteful, particularly if data are missing at a baseline evaluation. In this study, we present a novel approach to estimating missing item scores on both the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Our approach works on the assumption that patient response is non-uniform across items. By capturing the average between-item variation, we have developed a set of weights for each scale which can be used to predict missing item scores with high levels of accuracy. These weights were tested on several sets of patient data when one item was missing. The proposed weights are stable and will be of practical use to researchers in the field of Major Depression.",2001-Jul,International clinical psychopharmacology,Journal Article,2001,YES,sa,What assumption about patient response is central to predicting missing item scores on depression rating scales?,Patient response is non-uniform across items.,"The abstract states that the novel approach relies on the assumption of non-uniform patient response across items to estimate missing scores, using average between-item variation and calculated weights for accuracy."
15990509,"Herbs and nutrients in the treatment of depression, anxiety, insomnia, migraine, and obesity.","Although a multitude of pharmaceutical agents are available for the treatment of mood disorders, anxiety and insomnia, many patients have difficulty tolerating the side effects, do not respond adequately, or eventually lose their response. Many therapeutic herbs and nutrients have far fewer side effects and may provide an alternative treatment or can be used to enhance the effect of prescription medications. In the article, the authors review the quality of the evidence supporting the clinical effects of a number of commonly used types of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) for mood disorders, anxiety, and insomnia. They review data on the use of St. John's Wort, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e), B vitamins, inositol, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline for mood disorders; data on the use of kava and other herbal agents and fish extract for anxiety and insomnia; and data on valerian and melatonin for insomnia. The authors also discuss the use of CAM to treat migraines, which may be comorbid with mood and anxiety disorders, and obesity, which can occur as a side effect of psychotropic medications.

The views of 300 psychiatric out-patients and day-patients and 100 mental health workers concerning stigma were sought. The control group comprised 50 cardiac out-patients. A fair proportion of patients with schizophrenia or depression perceived that stigma had a negative effect on their self-esteem, relationships and job opportunities. The majority felt a need for an increase in public awareness of mental illness. In contrast, the cardiac patients reported very little stigmatization.

11288607,Comparative effects of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy in depression: a meta-analytic approach.,"This article reviews the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) in depression compared to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavioral therapy (BT). In this review, only studies in which at least 13 therapy sessions were performed have been included, and a sufficient number of patients per group were treated (N > or = 20). With regard to outcome criteria, the results were reviewed for improvements in depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, and social functioning. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. In 58 of the 60 comparisons (97%) performed in the six studies and their follow-ups, no significant difference could be detected between STPP and CBT/BT concerning the effects in depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptomatology, and social functioning. Furthermore, STPP and CBT/BT did not differ significantly with regard to the patients that were judged as remitted or improved. According to a meta-analytic procedure described by R. Rosenthal (1991) the studies do not differ significantly with regard to the patients that were judged as remitted or improved after treatment with STPP or CBT/BT. The mean difference between STPP and CBT/BT concerning the number of patients that were judged as remitted or improved corresponds to a small effect size (post-assessment: phi = 0.08, follow-up assessment: phi = 0.12). Thus, STPP and CBT/BT seem to be equally effective methods in the treatment of depression. However, because of the small number of studies which met the inclusion criteria, this result can only be preliminary. Furthermore, it applies only to the specific forms of STPP that were examined in the selected studies and cannot be generalized to other forms of STPP. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of specific forms of STPP in both controlled and naturalistic settings. Furthermore, there are findings indicating that 16-20 sessions of both STPP and CBT/BT are insufficient for most patients to achieve lasting remission. Future studies should address the effects of longer treatments of depression.",2001-Apr,Clinical psychology review,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Meta-Analysis,2001,YES,sa,What is the comparative efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or behavioral therapy (BT) in improving depressive symptoms and social functioning in patients with depression?,STPP and CBT/BT are equally effective in improving depressive symptoms and social functioning.,"The abstract states that STPP and CBT/BT showed no significant differences in depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, or social functioning in 97% of comparisons, indicating equivalent efficacy between the two treatments."

Adolescents evaluated after a suicide attempt that occurred between 1996 and 2000 were divided into two groups: suicide attempters with a history of SMB (n = 52) and suicide attempters without SMB (n = 43). The groups were then compared on psychiatric diagnosis, suicide intent, depression, hopelessness, loneliness, anger, reckless behavior, substance use, and family functioning. Carving on the skin and picking at a wound were the most commonly reported SMBs, occurring in about one third of the sample. The SMB group was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder, major depression, and dysthymia and had higher scores on measures of hopelessness, loneliness, anger, risk taking, reckless behavior, and alcohol use than did the non-SMB group. Loneliness increased the odds of SMB almost 6-fold. Adolescent suicide attempts with SMB are associated with greater cognitive/affective and behavioral symptoms.

11556436,Effects of mental health training and clinical audit on general practitioners' management of common mental disorders.,"To evaluate the effects of a seminar-based training program and clinical practice audit on general practitioners' (GPs') knowledge and management of common mental disorders. Survey of GPs' knowledge before and after training, and clinical practice audit and re-audit after feedback. GP volunteers from around Australia in 1998-1999: 1008 completed the pre-training test, 190 the post-training test, 386 the first audit (33235 patients), and 157 of these the re-audit (13280 patients), with 57 undertaking both audit and training. Four-seminar, 12-hour training program focused on improving GPs' capacity to identify and manage patients with depression and anxiety; practice audit with patient- and practice-based feedback on diagnosis and treatment of common mental disorders. Scores on pre- and post-training knowledge tests; self-rated improvements in confidence in managing patients with mental disorders after training; rates of psychological diagnoses and treatment by GPs on first audit and re-audit. GPs' knowledge of pharmacological treatments and clinical management improved after the training program (P<0.001), and 97% of GPs reported increased confidence in their management skills. GPs who undertook training had higher diagnosis rates for common mental disorders in the first audit than those who did not undertake training (36% versus 29%; P<0.001), and their diagnosis rates increased over time (36% to 39%; P<0.01), while those of GPs who did not undertake training were unchanged. Similarly, GPs who undertook training provided more mental health treatments than those who did not (30% versus 27% in the first audit [P<0.001], and 31% versus 24% at reaudit [P<0.001]). They also place greater emphasis on use of nonpharmacological treatments (24% versus 21% at first audit [P<0.001], and 25% versus 19% at re-audit [P<0.001]). Clinical audits may heighten awareness of mental disorders, but, on their own, they do not improve mental health practice.

11306249,Effects of bupropion SR on anterior paralimbic function during waking and REM sleep in depression: preliminary findings using.,"This study sought to clarify the effects of bupropion SR on anterior paralimbic function in depressed patients by studying changes in the activation of these structures from waking to REM sleep both before and after treatment. Twelve depressed patients underwent concurrent EEG sleep studies and [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scans during waking and during their second REM period of sleep before and after treatment with bupropion SR. Nine subjects completed pre- and post-treatment waking PET studies. Five subjects completed pre- and post-treatment waking and REM sleep PET studies. Bupropion SR treatment did not suppress electrophysiologic measures of REM sleep, nor did it alter an indirect measure of global metabolism during either waking or REM sleep. Bupropion SR treatment reversed the previously observed deficit in anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex and right anterior insula activation from waking to REM sleep. In secondary analyses, this effect was related to a reduction in waking relative metabolism in these structures following treatment in the absence of a significant effect on REM sleep relative metabolism. The implications of these findings for the relative importance of anterior paralimbic function in REM sleep in depression and for the differential effects of anti-depressant treatment on brain function during waking vs. REM sleep are discussed.",2001-Apr-10,Psychiatry research,"Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2001,YES,sa,How does bupropion SR treatment affect anterior paralimbic function during waking and REM sleep in depressed patients?,"Bupropion SR reverses deficits in anterior paralimbic activation from waking to REM sleep, reducing waking relative metabolism without significant effects on REM sleep relative metabolism.","The abstract states bupropion SR reverses anterior paralimbic deficits from waking to REM sleep, linked to reduced waking metabolism post-treatment, without altering REM sleep metabolism or suppressing REM electrophysiology."
11485052,An investigation of the mechanisms responsible for acute fluoxetine-induced anxiogenic-like effects in mice.,"Although selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in the chronic treatment of several anxiety disorders, increased anxiety has been observed in some patients at the beginning of treatment with these compounds. Similar increases in anxiety-related behaviors have been observed in animal studies following a single injection with SSRIs. The mechanism underlying this effect is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a variety of psychoactive compounds on the anxiogenic-like activity of fluoxetine. The drugs used included the benzodiazepine diazepam, the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspirone, the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists pindolol and WAY-100635, the non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists methiothepin, mianserin and ritanserin, the non-selective dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist haloperidol, the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride, the D2/3 agonist quinelorane, the cholecystokininB (CCK(B)) receptor antagonist LY 288513, and the corticotropin-releasing factor1 (CRF1) receptor antagonist CP-154,526. Experiments were performed in the free-exploration test. This model is based on the strong neophobic reactions exhibited by BALB/c mice when confronted simultaneously with a familiar and a novel environment. When administered alone, diazepam (1 and 2 mg/kg), buspirone (1 mg/kg) and mianserin (0.3 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects as they significantly increased exploratory activity of the novel compartment. In contrast, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) almost completely suppressed exploration of the novel area. Diazepam reversed the anxiogenic-like as well as the locomotor impairment induced by fluoxetine, while quinelorane blocked only the anxiogenic action of fluoxetine. None of the other compounds was able to counteract this effect. Taken together, these results suggest that dopaminergic mechanisms may underlie, at least in part, the behavioral effects of fluoxetine in the free-exploration test, whereas 5-HT1A 5-HT2, CCK(B) and CRF1 receptors may not be involved primarily in these effects.",2001-Jun,Behavioural pharmacology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,2001,YES,sa,Which pharmacological approach could counteract both the anxiogenic-like effect and locomotor impairment induced by fluoxetine in an anxiety model?,Diazepam.,"The abstract states that diazepam reversed both the anxiogenic-like effect and locomotor impairment caused by fluoxetine, while other compounds either had no effect or targeted only specific aspects of fluoxetine's actions."

11579986,Two strategies to increase adherence to HIV antiretroviral medication: life-steps and medication monitoring.,"Advances in the medical treatment of HIV have made it clear that adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment is a crucial feature for treatment success. The present paper had two goals: (1) to examine psychosocial predictors of adherence in persons receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy; (2) to compared two minimal-treatment interventions to increase HIV medication adherence in a subset of persons who self-reported less than perfect adherence. One of the interventions, Life-Steps, is a single-session intervention utilizing cognitive-behavioral, motivational interviewing, and problem-solving techniques. The other intervention, self-monitoring, utilizes a pill-diary and an adherence questionnaire alone. Significant correlates of adherence included depression, social support, adherence self-efficacy, and punishment beliefs about HIV.

However, the relationship between depression and functional dyspepsia is still obscure. We investigated the impact of depression on clinical symptoms and gastric dysrhythmia in functional dyspepsia. Thirty-nine patients with functional dyspepsia and 18 healthy subjects were included. Patients were investigated with clinical symptoms assessment, Zung's self-rating depression scale, and electrogastrography. Patients with functional dyspepsia were divided into two groups: 21 patients with depression and 18 patients without depression.

To review the technique of tryptophan depletion and its current status as a tool for investigating psychiatric disorders. Systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies. Tryptophan depletion produces a marked reduction in plasma tryptophan and consequently brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis and release. In healthy volunteers the effects of tryptophan depletion are influenced by the characteristics of the subjects and include some mood lowering, some memory impairment and an increase in aggression. In patients with depression tryptophan depletion tends to result in no worsening of depression in untreated subjects but a relapse in those who have responded to antidepressants (particularly serotonergic agents).

15014591,Treatment of Comorbid Tuberculosis and Depression.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading infectious cause of mortality worldwide. While the overall prevalence of TB in the United States has declined in the general population, certain groups remain at high risk, including the homeless, those who are HIV seropositive, individuals with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, and immigrants from a country in which TB is endemic. Many recipients of psychiatric services possess 1 or more of these risk factors, and consequently TB may be overrepresented in this population. Conversely, psychiatric illness may develop subsequent to TB infection. Mood disorders seem to be particularly common in TB patients compared with those with other medical diagnoses. It is important that primary care physicians understand the high prevalence of mental illness in TB patients so that proper treatment provisions can be implemented. Likewise, it is important for psychiatrists to understand the clinical manifestations of TB so that when a patient presents with symptoms of TB proper precautions can be taken and appropriate referrals can be made.

11740973,Effects of long-term lithium treatment on monoaminergic functions in major depression.,"Platelet [14C]serotonin uptake, the density of serotonin transporters and 5HT(2) receptors, and 5HT(2) and alpha(2) receptor function in platelets were investigated in 29 outpatients (15 women and 14 men) diagnosed as having a major affective disorder (21 bipolar and 8 unipolar). The data were compared with data for 26 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex and season. No differences were found in the mean values for the uptake velocity (V(max)) and the affinity (K(m)) of the transport carrier for serotonin between patients and controls. However, female patients had lower V(max) compared to male patients and female control subjects. A positive correlation between plasma lithium and V(max) and a tendency toward a negative correlation between plasma lithium and K(m) was observed. Furthermore, there were no differences in platelet B(max) and K(d) for [3H]paroxetine binding and K(d) for [3H]LSD binding between patients and controls. However, there was an increased number of platelet 5-HT(2) receptors and a difference in serotonin-mediated potentiation of platelet ATP secretion between patients compared to controls, especially in women. The findings in the present study suggest that lithium has a net ameliorating impact on serotonin uptake which may render it resistant to change. They also postulate that the effect of lithium may be attained by a dual influence on postsynaptic serotonergic structures, as it increases both the density and the sensitivity of 5-HT(2) receptors.",2001-Dec-15,Psychiatry research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2001,YES,sa,How might lithium impact serotonin uptake and postsynaptic serotonergic structures in patients with major affective disorders?,Lithium increases serotonin uptake velocity (Vmax) and enhances both the density and sensitivity of postsynaptic 5-HT(2) receptors.,"The abstract notes a positive correlation between plasma lithium and Vmax, alongside lithium’s dual influence of increasing 5-HT(2) receptor density and sensitivity, suggesting its ameliorating impact on serotonin uptake and postsynaptic structures."

15014583,Psychiatric and Somatic Markers of Anxiety: Identification and Pharmacologic Treatment.,"Anxiety disorders are widely prevalent but insufficiently recognized and inadequately treated in primary care practice. The annual costs of morbidity and mortality of these disorders approach $50 billion, substantially more than costs for schizophrenia or all affective disorders combined. Somatization of anxiety contributes to the challenges of making an accurate diagnosis and to the indirect costs associated with delaying appropriate treatment. Pharmacologic interventions give clinicians the necessary tools to treat anxiety safely and effectively. Former therapeutic choices were limited to benzodiazepines, buspirone, and older antidepressants, but newer anxiolytic agents have become available. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and agents with dual reuptake inhibition, such as venlafaxine XR, are optimizing therapy and yielding less risk for serious adverse events, greater safety in long-term therapy, and opportunity for improved patient compliance.

A sample of 252 primary school children ages 8 to 13 years were exposed to ambiguous stories of social situations and instructed to find out as quickly as possible whether a story was scary. Furthermore, children were invited to tell how each story would end and to judge how they would feel when actually confronted with that situation. The main results can be summarized as follows. First, socially anxious children displayed lower thresholds for threat perception than control children. In other words, compared with control children, socially anxious children needed to hear fewer sentences of a story before deciding it was scary. Furthermore, socially anxious children more frequently perceived threat while listening to the stories than did control children. Finally, socially anxious children more often interpreted the stories as threatening and displayed higher levels of negative feelings and cognitions in relation to these stories compared with control children. These findings fit nicely in current information-processing theories of childhood anxiety. An additional aim of this study was to investigate the convergent validity of the social phobia scales of 2 recently developed self-report questionnaires for measuring anxiety disorder symptoms in children: the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (Spence, 1998) and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (Birmaher et al., 1997).

11074108,QT dispersion in the surface electrocardiogram in elderly patients with major depression.,"QT dispersion (QTd) is a measure of interlead variations of QT interval of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Increased QTd, found in various cardiac diseases, reflects cardiac instability and is associated with increased cardiac death. Major depressive disorder (MDD) was found to be associated with high cardiovascular mortality rates. This study compares QTd in elderly patients with MDD to normal controls. QTd and rate-corrected QTd of 18 physically healthy elderly patients (69.9 +/- 7.6 years) with MDD was compared to nine physically and mentally healthy age- and gender-matched controls (64.1 +/- 12.2 years). QTd and rate-corrected QTd were significantly higher in MDD compared to controls (68 +/- 30 vs. 40 +/- 13 ms, P=0.002 and 81 +/- 39 vs. 43 +/- 13 ms, P=0.001, respectively). Intra- and inter- observer reproducibilities were highly correlated (r=0.96, P <0.0001; r=0.88, P <0.001, respectively). The major limitations of this study are the small number of subjects and the fact that all the patients were maintained on antidepressant medication.

10929691,Negative thinking mediates the effect of self-esteem on depressive symptoms in college women.,"One of every three women between 18 and 24 years of age may be significantly depressed. Younger women have shown increasing rates of unipolar depression since the 1950s, and the average age of onset continues to decline. To examine the prevalence and correlates of high depressive symptoms in single college women 18 to 24 years of age. Negative thinking was posited to mediate the relationship between self-esteem and depressive symptoms. A sample of 246 women was recruited from a university student body. Each woman completed a survey that included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the Crandell Cognitions Inventory, and the Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire. Of the women, 35% had high depressive symptoms. Negative thinking mediated the relationship between self-esteem and depressive symptoms.

This is the first study of risk factors for depression in a representative sample of older people selected for high vulnerability because of physical ill health. Subjects identified in an epidemiological community survey of morbidity in people > or =65 years old, who had activity limitation (ADL) but no psychiatric morbidity were reinterviewed after 3 years. 79 (90%) of subjects were interviewed. Ten percent developed pervasive depression and 24% screened positive for depression. This latter group were more likely to consult doctors than others with similar levels of disability (P<0.005) mainly because of an acute physical illness. Frequent pain was associated with the development of depression (P<0.02). Older people who are ADL limited are known to be at high risk for depression. For the majority who do not become depressed, chronicity of illness does not lead to depression.

The aim of this review is to evaluate the outcome of two clinical trials comparing reboxetine and fluoxetine on depressive symptoms and social functioning. These studies used both conventional measures of outcome such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS), a patient-centred, disease non-specific scale of social functioning, which was developed for measuring social functioning in depressed people. These findings, set against a background of all studies in which antidepressants have been compared using quality of life instruments, suggest that while some patients may appear to the clinician to have recovered, they may remain less than fully well and differences in selectivity for neurotransmitter systems may play a part in the degree of wellbeing that recovered patients might expect.",2000,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica.

Schreter, MD.","Pharmacy costs are outpacing other healthcare expenditures, with psychotropic medications accounting for 16% to 25% of the total pharmacy costs. Managed care organizations (MCOs) can be expected to exert considerable pressure to control such costs. Avenues for cost containment include changing the management and spending decisions of MCOs, influencing physician prescribing patterns, encouraging economically efficient pharmacy policies and procedures, and controlling patient access to prescription drugs. From the cost standpoint of an MCO, briefer approaches to treating depressed patients are desirable.

10789534,Costing depression and its management: an Australian study.,"To examine the cost impact of referral to a Mood Disorders Unit (MDU), by comparing pre-service and post-service costs, and MDU and control samples. We studied tertiary referral MDU patients and a control group of consultants' depressed patients, with the principal comparison intervals being: (i) 12 months prior to and (ii) 6 months following baseline assessment, with costs annualised to allow the impact of assessment and treatment recommendation to be determined. In addition, we assessed any 'personal cost' of depression. Following baseline assessment, MDU referrals showed a reduction in costs, while controls' costs increased, largely driven by contrasting directions in hospitalisation and social welfare costs. We identify variables associated with high and increased costs, including features of the earlier stages of the disorder, whether social welfare was received, diagnostic subtype and personality dysfunction, with multivariate analyses refining the variable sets. Self-report data indicated that patients judged the 'personal cost' of depression to exceed more formal cost parameters, so that to experience depression is itself depressogenic.

10700654,Increased tonic activation of rat forebrain 5-HT(1A) receptors by lithium addition to antidepressant treatments.,"The present study was undertaken to determine whether lithium addition to long-term treatment with different classes of antidepressant drugs could induce a greater effect on the serotonin (5-HT) system than the drugs given alone. Because 5-HT(1A) receptor activation hyperpolarizes and inhibits the firing activity of CA(3) pyramidal neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, the degree of disinhibition produced by the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635 was determined using in vivo extracellular recordings. In controls, as well as in rats receiving a lithium diet for 3 days, the administration of WAY 100635 (25-100 microg/kg, IV) did not modify the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons. When the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (10 mg/kg/day, SC), the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine (2.5 mg/kg/day, SC) and the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day, SC) were administered alone for 21 days, a dose of 50 microg/kg of WAY 100635 was needed to increase significantly the firing activity of these neurons. On the other hand, WAY 100635, at a dose of only 25 microg/kg, increased significantly the firing rate of CA(3) pyramidal neurons in rats receiving both a long-term antidepressant treatment and a short-term lithium diet. It is concluded that the addition of lithium to antidepressant treatments produced a greater disinhibition of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons than any treatments given alone. The present results support the notion that the addition of lithium to antidepressants may produce a therapeutic response in treatment-resistant depression by enhancing 5-HT neurotransmission.",2000-Apr,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2000,YES,sa,What pharmacological strategy could enhance serotonin neurotransmission in treatment-resistant depression by modulating CA(3) pyramidal neuron activity?,Adding lithium to long-term antidepressant therapy.,"The abstract shows lithium addition to antidepressants significantly increases CA(3) pyramidal neuron firing via enhanced serotonin neurotransmission, supporting its use in treatment-resistant depression."

At baseline, 12.8% of the older persons had minor depression and 2.0% major depression. Minor depression was associated with a significantly greater decline in functional status and performance and, only in men but not in women, with an increased risk of death. Major depression also increases decline in functional status and the risk of death (irrespective of sex), but was not associated with decline in physical performance.

10815649,New directions in the treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.,"This article reviews options in the treatment of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction (SD). With adoption of structured interviews concerning sexual function, researchers have become increasingly aware that a substantial proportion of patients experience untoward sexual side effects from their antidepressants. As many as half of patients treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors report delayed orgasm (ejaculation), and virtually all patients treated with clomipramine experience anorgasmia. Treatments proven to be effective include yohimbine, sildenafil citrate, buspirone, or other adjuncts, or a temporary drug holiday. SD is most effectively diagnosed and treated in the setting of an empathic physician-patient relationship, which includes frank discussions about sexuality. Although depressed patients do care about their sexual function, they may be reluctant, for fear of embarrassment, to report SD spontaneously to their physicians. SD is probably underreported and may result in covert noncompliance and attendant relapse into depression. Physicians thus need to assess sexual function during initial evaluation and throughout treatment. The importance of sexual function to sexually active patients with major depression should be weighed carefully when planning antidepressant therapy. A number of viable options exist to prevent or treat SD, including use of relatively new or novel antidepressants and appropriate adjunctive regimens.",2000,Clinical therapeutics,Journal Article; Review,2000,YES,sa,What are two strategies to address antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in patients with major depression who report delayed orgasm or anorgasmia?,"Adjunctive treatments like sildenafil citrate or buspirone, or a temporary drug holiday.","The abstract identifies adjunctive treatments and temporary drug holidays as proven strategies to manage sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants, emphasizing the importance of addressing this issue to prevent noncompliance and depression relapse."

10746914,The waxing and waning of mental disorders: evaluating the stability of syndromes of mental disorders in the population.,"This article examines the stability of symptoms, syndromes, and diagnoses of specific anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as diagnostic shifts from one syndrome to another over time. Using retrospective and longitudinal prospective data from the baseline and first follow-up investigation (19.7 months later) of the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology Study (EDSP), we focus on establishing stability measures for early stages of mental disorders in a community sample of adolescents aged 14 to 17 years at baseline. The results are as follows: (1) Although only about 30% developed a full-blown DSM-IV disorder, psychopathological syndromes are widespread in adolescents: 15% of the population aged 14 to 17 at baseline were not affected by at least some clinically relevant symptoms of mental disorders either throughout their previous life or throughout the follow-up period. (2) The likelihood of staying free of symptoms and threshold disorders during follow-up was highest among subjects who were completely well at baseline. The probability of a positive outcome decreased as a function of severity of baseline diagnostic status. (3) There was a considerable degree of fluctuation not only in the diagnostic status and severity of specific disorders, but also in terms of complete remissions and shifts from one syndrome and disorder to another. (4) Anxiety disorders, overall, slightly differ with regard to the persistence and stability of the diagnostic status from depressive disorders. (5) However, there were remarkable differences between specific types of anxiety and depressive disorders. Consistent with other longitudinal epidemiological studies in the general population, this study finds that the syndromes and diagnoses of mental disorders have a strong tendency to wax and wane over time in this age group.",2000,Comprehensive psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2000,YES,sa,What factors predict a positive outcome in adolescents with anxiety or depressive disorders during follow-up?,Being symptom-free at baseline predicts the highest likelihood of a positive outcome during follow-up.,"The abstract states that the likelihood of staying symptom-free during follow-up was highest among adolescents who were completely well at baseline, with outcomes worsening as baseline severity increased."

The introduction of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has, more than any other development, bridged the gap in terms of efficacy in both sets of disorders. A substantial body of data exists suggesting that the available SSRIs have substantial efficacy in anxiety symptoms co-occurring with depression.

11203058,The biology of depression.,Depression is a common psychiatric disorder prevalent in 10-15% in general population. To know the biology of the disease many hypotheses have been proposed. Genetic basis for depression is provided by family studies which show higher risk of depression among first degree relatives. Abnormalities in serotonergic activity in depression can occur in one or more levels. Other neurotransmitters like gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and dopamine are also considered to have some role in depression. Hormonal abnormalities like hypercortisolaemia are found in patients with depression. Structural and functional neuro-imaging studies in depression suggest the involvement of brain in depressive disorders.,2000-May,Journal of the Indian Medical Association,Journal Article; Review,2000,YES,sa,"Which neurotransmitter abnormalities might contribute to the pathophysiology of depression, and what hormonal dysregulation is commonly observed in patients with this condition?","Serotonin, GABA, and dopamine abnormalities; hypercortisolaemia is the hormonal dysregulation.","The abstract identifies serotonergic activity, GABA, and dopamine as implicated in depression and highlights hypercortisolaemia as a hormonal abnormality commonly observed in affected patients."
11082474,Birth outcomes following prenatal exposure to fluoxetine.,"Although pregnancy has frequently been described as a time of emotional well-being, some women experience significant antenatal depression that may require treatment with antidepressants. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relative effects of early and late trimester exposure to fluoxetine and perinatal outcome. Obstetric and neonatal records were reviewed for 64 mother-infant pairs where there was documented use of fluoxetine at some point during pregnancy. Differences in several measures of obstetrical outcome and neonatal well-being were examined in early trimester- and late trimester-exposed infants. No differences in birth weight and acute neonatal outcome were evident across the two groups, though there was a higher frequency of special care nursery admissions for infants with exposure to fluoxetine late in pregnancy. Special care nursery admissions could not be attributed to any specific factor. Given the growing numbers of women who are treated with antidepressants, including fluoxetine, during pregnancy, and the strong association between depression during pregnancy and risk for postpartum depression, patients may be best advised to continue treatment with antidepressants through labor and delivery versus making any change in intensity of treatment during the acute peripartum period.",2000-Nov-15,Biological psychiatry,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2000,YES,sa,What neonatal complication is more likely to occur when fluoxetine is used during late pregnancy compared to early pregnancy?,Increased frequency of special care nursery admissions.,"The abstract notes a higher frequency of special care nursery admissions for infants exposed to fluoxetine late in pregnancy, though no specific factor was identified to explain this outcome."
10674276,Interaction of desipramine with steroid hormones on experimental anxiety.,"The present study analyzes if estradiol benzoate and/or progesterone interact with desmethylimipramine (DMI) to diminish experimental anxiety. The animal model of anxiety used was the conditioned defensive burying test. Dose response curves for DMI (0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, every 24 h, during 21 days), estradiol benzoate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 micrograms/rat, 48 h) and progesterone (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/rat, -4 h) were made in ovariectomized rats. DMI per se decreased dose dependently the cumulative burying time, an effect considered as anxiolytic-like. Progesterone produced a decrease in burying at the highest dose, while estradiol benzoate had no effect on defensive burying. Both, progesterone (0.5 mg/rat) and estradiol benzoate (4.0 micrograms/rat) were able to decrease the cumulative burying behavior when injected with a subthreshold dose of DMI (1.25 mg/kg). In addition, the effect of DMI (1.25 mg/kg) plus the combination of estradiol benzoate and progesterone, sequentially administered (48 h and 4 h before the tests, respectively), also produced a synergistic decrease in burying behavior. In general, the treatments produced no changes in burying behavior latency, neither in spontaneous ambulation or in nociception. It is concluded that DMI synergizes its anxiolytic-like effect when administered with estradiol alone or in combination with progesterone.

11209991,"The design, implementation, and acceptance of a primary care-based intervention to prevent depression relapse.","This article describes the conceptual underpinnings, implementation, and participation rates of a twelve-month low-intensity primary care-based intervention to prevent depression relapse. The intervention was designed to address the inherent problems in delivery of effective maintenance treatment in a population based sample of primary care patients. Patients at high risk of relapse based on psychiatric history who recovered from depression six to eight weeks after initiation of pharmacotherapy by their primary care physician were eligible; 194 were randomized to receive the intervention. The intervention combined education about depression, motivation-enhancing shared decision-making regarding the use of maintenance pharmacotherapy, and cognitive-behavioral strategies. The program included two visits with a Depression Prevention Specialist working in tandem with the primary care physician at the primary care clinic, with supervision and back up from a consulting psychiatrist, proactive follow-up telephone calls and mailed personalized feedback. Ninety-three percent of patients attended both in-person visits; 97 percent attended one visit. Eighty percent of patients completed all three follow-up telephone calls, and 85 percent returned at least one mailed feedback form; 48 percent returned all four forms. Offered a menu of options for self-management, most patients chose medication as well as a variety of behavioral strategies.

To determine the proportion of probable cases of women with mental disorders and examine the associated conditions and risk factors which contribute to maternal mental ill-health. With convenient sampling 260 mothers in an urban squatter settlement of Karachi were interviewed. The tools consisted of a household questionnaire collecting information on basic demographic and other characteristics and the Aga Khan University Anxiety and Depression Scale (AKUADS), an instrument to assess psychiatric morbidity. The proportion of probable cases of mental disorder was 28.8% (n = 75). Reviewing the gradient of responses the most frequently expressed psychiatric symptoms were ""being worried"" and ""crying"".

Most previous family, twin, and adoption studies of these disorders have used cases ascertained through treatment settings, who may differ from cases in epidemiological samples. We studied the importance of genetic influences on risk for lifetime comorbidity of major depression and alcoholism by means of a population-based twin sample. Lifetime major depression (MD), alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence were assessed by structured interview for both members of 3755 twin pairs from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. Pair resemblance was analyzed by means of structural equation models. Individuals with MD were at significantly increased risk for alcohol dependence and for a combined diagnosis of alcohol abuse and/or dependence. History of MD in a twin significantly increased the risk of cotwin alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse and/or dependence among identical male pairs and for alcohol abuse and/or dependence in identical female pairs, but not among male or female fraternal pairs. Results of structural modeling indicate that comorbidity occurs because the genetic and specific environmental sources of liability to MD overlap with those underlying alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse and/or dependence. This overlap was significant only within sex, not across sexes. In this population-based twin sample, the familial transmission of MD and alcohol dependence was largely disorder specific. Comorbidity appears to be due to sex-specific genetic and environmental risk factors.

10847625,Toward an interpersonal life-stress model of depression: the developmental context of stress generation.,"The validity of a developmentally based life-stress model of depression was evaluated in 88 clinic-referred youngsters. The model focused on (a) the role of child-environment transactions, (b) the specificity of stress-psychopathology relations, and (c) the consideration of both episodic and chronic stress. Semistructured diagnostic and life-stress interviews were administered to youngsters and their parents. As predicted, in the total sample child depression was associated with interpersonal episodic and chronic stress, whereas externalizing disorder was associated with noninterpersonal episodic and chronic stress. However, the pattern of results differed somewhat in boys and girls. Youngsters with comorbid depression and externalizing disorder tended to experience the highest stress levels. Support was obtained for a stress-generation model of depression, wherein children precipitate stressful events and circumstances. In fact, stress that was in part dependent on children's contribution distinguished best among diagnostic groups, whereas independent stress had little discriminative power.

10890313,Serotonin autoreceptor function and antidepressant drug action.,"This article briefly summarizes, within the context of a brief review of the relevant literature, the outcome of our recent rat microdialysis studies on (1) the relative importance of serotonin (5-HT)1A versus 5-HT1B autoreceptors in the mechanism of action of 5-HT reuptake blocking agents, including putative regional differences in this regard, and (2) autoreceptor responsiveness following chronic SSRI administration. First, our data are consistent with the primacy of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in restraining the elevation of 5-HT levels induced by SSRIs, whereas nerve terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptors appear to have an accessory role in this regard. Second, there is an important interplay between cell body and nerve terminal 5-HT autoreceptors, and recent findings suggest that this interplay may potentially be exploited to obtain regionally preferential effects on 5-HT neurotransmission in the central nervous system, even upon systemic drug administration. In particular, emerging data suggest that somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor- and nerve terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptor-mediated feedback may be relatively more important in the control of 5-HT output in dorsal raphe-frontal cortex and median raphe-dorsal hippocampus systems, respectively. Third, 5-HT autoreceptors evidently retain the capability to limit the 5-HT transmission-promoting effect of SSRIs after chronic treatment. Thus, although the responsiveness of these sites is probably somewhat reduced, residual autoreceptor capacity still remains an effective restraint on large increases in extracellular 5-HT, even after prolonged treatment. If a further increase in extracellular 5-HT is crucial to the remission of depression in patients responding only partially to prolonged administration of antidepressants, then sustained adjunctive treatment with autoreceptor-blocking drugs may consequently prove useful in the long term.",2000-Jun,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Review",2000,YES,sa,What pharmacological strategy could enhance serotonin transmission in patients with partial response to chronic SSRI treatment?,Adjunctive treatment with 5-HT autoreceptor-blocking drugs.,"The abstract states that 5-HT autoreceptors remain capable of restraining serotonin transmission even after prolonged SSRI treatment.

10703760,New approaches to the treatment of refractory depression.,"Although the majority of patients with depression respond well to their initial pharmacologic treatment, as many as 30% to 45% fail to achieve an adequate response. In addition to the more traditional lithium and thyroid hormone augmentation strategies, a number of new pharmacotherapeutic approaches are currently being used to help manage refractory depression, including the addition of another agent or a switch to another antidepressant. Augmentation and switching strategies are often selected in order to obtain a different neurochemical effect (e.g., adding a relatively noradrenergic agent to a relatively serotonergic antidepressant). In particular, several studies have suggested that depressed patients refractory to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may show a good response to newer agents that have a pharmacologic profile distinct from the SSRIs. Furthermore, preliminary studies have shown that the addition of SSRIs to either noradrenergic drugs such as the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or dopaminergic agents may be efficacious, even though concerns about drug-drug interactions and tricyclic cardiac toxicity have limited the use of TCA-SSRI combinations. The introduction of reboxetine, a relatively selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may increase the use of the latter therapeutic approach because of its improved safety profile compared with the TCAs. The review of treatment options for refractory depression that follows will outline the advantages, disadvantages, and level of support for a number of new treatment strategies.",2000,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,2000,YES,sa,"What pharmacologic strategy might be considered for a patient with depression who has not responded to SSRIs, and how does this strategy address neurochemical differences?","Switch to a newer agent with a pharmacologic profile distinct from SSRIs, or augment with a noradrenergic or dopaminergic agent.","The abstract notes that patients refractory to SSRIs may respond to agents with distinct pharmacologic profiles or augmentation with noradrenergic/dopaminergic drugs, leveraging different neurochemical effects."

25522398,5-HT2C receptor desensitization moderates anxiety in 5-HTT deficient mice: from behavioral to cellular evidence.,"Desensitization and blockade of 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2CR) have long been thought to be central in the therapeutic action of antidepressant drugs. However, besides behavioral pharmacology studies, there is little in vivo data documenting antidepressant-induced 5-HT2CR desensitization in specific brain areas. Mice lacking the 5-HT reuptake carrier (5-HTT(-/-)) were used to model the consequences of chronic 5-HT reuptake inhibition with antidepressant drugs. The effect of this mutation on 5-HT2CR was evaluated at the behavioral (social interaction, novelty-suppressed feeding, and 5-HT2CR-induced hypolocomotion tests), the neurochemical, and the cellular (RT-qPCR, mRNA editing, and c-fos-induced expression) levels. Although 5-HTT(-/-) mice had an anxiogenic profile in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, they displayed less 5-HT2CR-mediated anxiety in response to the agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine in the social interaction test. In addition, 5-HT2CR-mediated inhibition of a stress-induced increase in 5-HT turnover, measured in various brain areas, was markedly reduced in 5-HTT(-/-) mutants. These indices of tolerance to 5-HT2CR stimulation were associated neither with altered levels of 5-HT2CR protein and mRNA nor with changes in pre-mRNA editing in the frontal cortex. However, basal c-fos mRNA production in cells expressing 5-HT2CR was higher in 5-HTT(-/-) mutants, suggesting an altered basal activity of these cells following sustained 5-HT reuptake carrier inactivation. Furthermore, the increased c-fos mRNA expression in 5-HT2CR-like immune-positive cortical cells observed in wild-type mice treated acutely with the 5-HT2CR agonist RO-60,0175 was absent in 5-HTT(-/-) mutants. Such blunted responsiveness of the 5-HT2CR system, observed at the cell signaling level, probably contributes to the moderation of the anxiety phenotype in 5-HTT(-/-) mice.",2014-Oct-31,The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,How might chronic inhibition of the serotonin reuptake transporter impact 5-HT2C receptor-mediated anxiety responses in the brain?,Chronic inhibition may blunt 5-HT2C receptor-mediated anxiety responses by reducing receptor responsiveness without altering receptor protein/mRNA levels or pre-mRNA editing.,"The abstract shows chronic serotonin reuptake inhibition leads to reduced 5-HT2C receptor responsiveness, evident in behavioral and cellular changes, despite unaltered receptor expression or editing, contributing to moderated anxiety phenotypes."
25171340,Higher quality of life and lower depression for people on ART in Uganda as compared to a community control group.,"Provision of antiretroviral treatment (ART) to people living with HIV (PLWH) has increased globally. Research measuring whether ART restores subjective well-being to ""normal"" levels is lacking, particularly in resource limited settings. The study objectives are to compare quality of life and depression symptoms for PLWH on ART to a general community population and to explore factors to explain these differences, including socio-economic status and the impact of urban or rural residence. PLWH on ART (n = 263) were recruited from ART delivery sites and participants not on ART (n = 160) were recruited from communities in Wakiso District, Uganda. Participants were interviewed using the translated World Health Organisation Quality of Life brief measure, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression section, and questions about socio-economic status, residence as urban or rural and, for PLWH on ART, self-reported adherence and use of HIV counselling. Compared to the community sample and controlling for location of residence, PLWH on ART had significantly higher quality of life (QOL) for physical, psychological and environment domains, but not the social domain. These differences were not due to socio-economic status alone. Depression scores were significantly lower for PLWH on ART. Both comparisons controlled for the effect of location of residence. People on ART self-reported high adherence and the majority had used HIV counselling services. Our findings show better QOL amongst PLWH on ART compared to a general community sample, which cannot be explained solely by differences in socio-economic status nor location of residence. The general community sample results point towards the challenges of life in this setting.

24660689,Naturalistic interpersonal behavior patterns differentiate depression and anxiety symptoms in the community.,"Symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with interpersonal problems that, in turn, exacerbate and maintain these symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to identify patterns of interpersonal behavior characteristic of each syndrome, particularly whether intraindividual variability in interpersonal behavior differentiates between anxiety and depression symptoms. After reporting on depression and anxiety symptoms, community participants recorded their behavior following interpersonal interactions over 21 days. Participants' interpersonal behavior at each event was measured using behavior dimensions from the interpersonal circumplex: dominant, submissive, agreeable, and quarrelsome. Mean levels of behavior and intraindividual variability were computed over events and then regressed on depression and anxiety symptoms using structural equation modeling. Elevations in reported depression and anxiety symptoms were both associated with elevated mean-level quarrelsome and submissive behavior. Independent of mean-level behavior and concurrent depression symptoms, elevated anxiety symptoms were associated with elevated variability in agreeable, dominant, and submissive behavior and with elevated variability in type of interpersonal behavior (i.e., spin). Depression symptoms were unrelated to variability in interpersonal behavior. Results demonstrate that variability in behavior distinguishes anxiety from depression symptoms.",2014-Apr,Journal of counseling psychology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,How can intraindividual variability in interpersonal behavior help differentiate clinical anxiety from clinical depression?,"Clinical anxiety is associated with elevated variability in agreeable, dominant, submissive behavior, and interpersonal spin, whereas depression is unrelated to such variability.","The abstract states that anxiety symptoms show elevated variability in interpersonal behaviors and spin, whereas depression symptoms are linked only to mean-level quarrelsome and submissive behavior without variability."

25527877,Extent of preoperative depression is associated with return to work after lumbar fusion for spondylolisthesis.,"The ability to understand factors associated with an increased duration of missed work postoperatively could be used to more effectively select patients with the greatest opportunity for a successful outcome. We set out to determine the effect of preoperative depression on postoperative return to work in patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative spondylolisthesis. Fifty-eight patients undergoing TLIF for symptomatic grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis were included in this analysis. Patient demographics, clinical presentation, indications for surgery, radiologic studies, and operative variables were assessed for each case. Patient-assessed outcome measures were obtained prospectively at baseline and 2 years postoperatively. To understand the factors associated with prolonged return to work, univariate linear regression analysis and stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used. All patient-reported outcomes assessed were significantly improved 2 years after TLIF (P < 0.001). Of the 32 patients working preoperatively, 26 (81%) returned to work postoperatively. Median time to return to work was 56 days (range, 10-150 days). Independent of patient age; preoperative pain, disability, and quality of life; and extent of postoperative improvement, increased preoperative Zung depression score remained associated with prolonged return to work (P = 0.02). Independent of postoperative improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life, the extent of preoperative depression was an independent predictor of time to return to work in patients undergoing TLIF for spondylolisthesis, suggesting that regardless of how successful TLIF surgery may be at improving a patient's pain, disability, or quality of life, greater depression will delay or prohibit their ability to return to work postoperatively.",2015-Apr,World neurosurgery,Journal Article,2014,YES,sa,How does the severity of preoperative depression impact the timeline for returning to work after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative spondylolisthesis?,Greater preoperative depression severity is independently associated with a prolonged time to return to work postoperatively.,"The abstract identifies preoperative depression, measured via Zung depression score, as an independent predictor of delayed return to work, regardless of postoperative improvements in pain, disability, or quality of life."
24390719,Somatic symptoms in children with anxiety disorders: an exploratory cross-sectional study of the relationship between subjective and objective measures.,"Symptoms of childhood anxiety disorders include activation of bodily stress systems to fear stimuli, indicating alterations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Self-reported somatic symptoms are frequently reported, while studies including objective measures of ANS are scarce and show inconsistent results. Even less studied is the relationship between subjective and objective measures of somatic symptoms in anxious children. Increased knowledge of this relationship may have relevance for treatment programmes for anxiety disorders. This cross-sectional study examined subjective and objective measures of ANS responsiveness in a clinical sample of children with anxiety disorders (7-13 years; n = 23) and in healthy controls (HC; n = 22) with equal distributions of gender and age. The subjective measure used was the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, which includes a subscale on somatic symptoms. The objective measures consisted of an orthostatic challenge (head-up tilt test), and an isometric muscular exercise (handgrip) while the participants were attached to the Task Force Monitor, a combined hardware and software device used for continuous, non-invasive recording of cardiovascular variables. The anxiety disorder group reported significantly more somatic symptoms than HCs (both by mother and child reports). In contrast, no relevant differences in cardiovascular variables were demonstrated between the anxiety group and HCs. Finally, there were no significant correlations between subjective and objective measures in either group.

24813032,The relationship of the Korean version of the WHO Five Well-Being Index with depressive symptoms and quality of life in the community-dwelling elderly.,"Depression in the geriatric population is becoming markedly more prevalent. Quality of life has been linked with the development of depression. A screening tool for assessing both geriatric depression and quality of life is needed. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of the Korean version of the World Health Organization Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) in evaluating geriatric depression and quality of life as compared to the widely used Short Geriatric Depression Scale of Korean version (SGDS-K). Two hundred and forty four elderly people (>60-years-of-age) living in the Yanggu and Inje areas of Gangwon Province, Korea, were interviewed and responded to scales including WHO-5, SGDS-K, Mini Mental Status Examination in the Korean version of the CERAD assessment packet (MMSE-KC), and Geriatric Quality of Life-Dementia (GQOL-D). A total WHO-5 score<13 indicated low well-being. The SGDS-K score showed a reverse correlation with the WHO-5, MMSE-KC, and GQOL-D scores. The WHO-5 score reversely correlated with the SGDS-K score and positively correlated with GQOL-D, but showed no significant correlation with MMSE-KC score.

25601821,The Role of Stress Exposure and Family Functioning in Internalizing Outcomes of Urban Families.,"Although research suggests that stress exposure and family functioning are associated with internalizing problems in adolescents and caregivers, surprisingly few studies have investigated the mechanisms that underlie this association. To determine whether family functioning buffers the development of internalizing problems in stress-exposed families, we assessed the relation between stress exposure, family functioning, and internalizing symptoms among a large sample of inner-city male youth and their caregivers living in poverty across five waves of data collection. We hypothesized that stress exposure and family functioning would predict development of subsequent youth and caregiver internalizing problems and that family functioning would moderate this relation, with higher functioning families demonstrating greater resiliency to stress exposure. We used a longitudinal, prospective design to evaluate whether family functioning (assessed at waves one through four) activated or buffered the effects of stress exposure (assessed at wave one) on subsequent internalizing symptoms (assessed at waves four and five). Stress from Developmental Transitions and family functioning were significant predictors of depressive symptoms and anxiety in youth; however, family functioning did not moderate the relation. Family functioning mediated the relation between stress from Daily Hassles and internalizing outcomes suggesting that poor parenting practices, low structure, and low emotional cohesion activate depression and anxiety in youth exposed to chronic and frequent everyday stressors. Surprisingly, only family functioning predicted depressive symptoms in caregivers. Results validate the use of a comprehensive, multi-informant assessment of stress when investigating internalizing outcomes in youth and support using family-based interventions in the treatment and prevention of internalizing.",2014-Nov,Journal of child and family studies,Journal Article,2014,YES,sa,How might family functioning mediate the relationship between chronic daily stressors and internalizing symptoms in adolescents?,"Poor parenting practices, low structure, and low emotional cohesion activate depression and anxiety in adolescents exposed to frequent daily stressors.","The abstract indicates that family functioning mediates the impact of daily hassles on internalizing outcomes, with poor family dynamics exacerbating depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth exposed to chronic stress."
25618127,The lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders among patients with irritable bowel syndrome.,"The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, ranges from 10% to 20% in the general population. It is estimated that from 40% to 90% of persons with a diagnosis of IBS suffer from mental disorders, mainly anxiety and depressive disorders. The aim of the study was to assess the lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders in IBS patients and to compare it with the prevalence of these disorders in a control group of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study included 106 patients with IBS and 53 patients with GERD. IBS was diagnosed according to the Rome II criteria after a basic evaluation to exclude an organic disease. Anxiety disorders were diagnosed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) in accordance with ICD-10 diagnostic criteria. Anxiety disorders during the patient's lifetime were diagnosed in 50 IBS patients (47%). Specific phobias occurred in 23.5% of them, social phobias in 10.4%, generalized anxiety disorder in 10.4%, panic disorder in 3.8% and agoraphobia in 8.5%. In the control group with GERD, anxiety disorders during the subject's lifetime were diagnosed in 30% of the group. The difference in the prevalence of anxiety disorders between patients with IBS and GERD was statistically significant (p<0.05).

25562022,The effects of decreasing maternal anxiety on fetal oxygenation and nucleated red blood cells count in the cord blood.,"Vasoconstriction during anxiety reduces fetal oxygenation and leads to hypoxia. Hypoxia in turn results in increase of the number of nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in the cord blood. The present study aimed to assess the effect of decreasing maternal anxiety on fetal oxygenation and NRBCs count in the cord blood. . In this study, 150 women were randomly divided into two intervention groups [supportive care and acupressure in BL32 (bladder) acupoint] and a control group (hospital routine care). The infants' cord blood was investigated regarding the number of NRBCs and the intensity of hypoxia after birth. Then, the data were entered into the SPSS statistical software (v. 16) and analyzed using ANOVA, Chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Findings : The significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the number of NRBCs counted in the peripheral blood smear (P<0.001). Besides, a significant relationship was observed between the length of the first and second stages of labor and the number of NRBCs in the cord blood (P=0.01). Also, a significant association was observed between the type of delivery and the number of NRBCs in the cord blood in both intervention (P<0.001) and control groups (P=0.03). Doula supportive care and acupressure at BL32 point reduced the length of labor stages as well as the anxiety level.

Existing studies have focused on 12-week antidepressant trials. We used data from a concurrent antidepressant and psychotherapy trial over a 6-month period. Eight hundred twenty-one patients were randomized to receive either fluoxetine or tianepine and received cognitive-behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, or psychodynamic therapy. Patients completed the Montgomery-Åsberg depression rating scale (MADRS) at the 0, 1, 3, and 6-month periods. Patients also completed measures of dysfunctional attitudes, functioning, and personality. GMM was conducted using MADRS scores and the number of growth classes to be retained was based on the Bayesian information criterion. Criteria supported the presence of four distinct latent growth classes representing gradual responders of high severity (42% of sample), gradual responders of moderate severity (31%), nonresponders (15%), and rapid responders (11%). Initial severity, greater use of emotional coping strategies, less use of avoidance coping strategies, introversion, and less emotional stability predicted nonresponder status. Growth classes were not associated with different treatments or with proportion of dropouts. The longer time period used in this study highlights potential overestimates of nonresponders in previous research and the need for continued assessments.

24696870,Spotlight on depression: a Pharma Matters report.,"Depression represents a huge pharmaceutical market opportunity. There are approximately 350 million people worldwide with depression, and it is the leading cause of disability in the world. In the U.S., 9.1% of the population suffers from depression. Globally, fewer than half of depression sufferers receive treatment for their illness, and in some countries this figure falls to fewer than 1 in 10. The high incidence rate, combined with limited market penetration, makes depression a high potential market for pharmaceuticals. However, companies developing drugs for depression also face a number of serious challenges. Psychosocial treatment options remain the preferred first-line therapy ahead of medication-and when it comes to drug treatment, the abundance of generic options available has significantly contributed to halving the value of the branded antidepressant market over recent years. Another hurdle faced by new drugs is the requirement that all antidepressants carry a black-box warning regarding the increased risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults, which limits their use in this population. Switching between medications presents both an opportunity and a challenge, as a significant number of patients will switch away from their first medication within the first year of treatment. The lack of complete understanding of why depression occurs also makes this area a difficult one, although it opens the door for the development of drugs with novel mechanisms of action.",2014-Mar,"Drugs of today (Barcelona, Spain : 1998)",Journal Article; Review,2014,YES,sa,What is one major challenge pharmaceutical companies face when developing antidepressants for younger populations?,"The requirement for a black-box warning about increased suicide risk in children, adolescents, and young adults.","The abstract states that all antidepressants must carry a black-box warning for suicide risk in younger populations, limiting their use and posing a challenge for drug development."

The review covers the role of PROG and its metabolites in psychiatric disorders, focusing on results from preclinical and some clinical studies that support the relationship between alterations on PROG levels and pathophysiology of psychiatric illness. We also discussed the main mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of PROG metabolites. Our review points out the possible relationship between PROG and its metabolites and the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, both preclinical and clinical studies show that certain treatments (antidepressants or antipsychotics) may normalize the levels of PROG, suggesting that the amelioration of psychiatric symptoms may occur due to upregulation of PROG metabolites.

26788330,What light have resting state fMRI studies shed on cognition and mood in Parkinson's disease?,"Much remains unknown about non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), which have variable occurrence, progression, and severity among patients. The existing suite of neuroimaging tools has yielded insight that cannot be garnered by traditional methods such as behavioral and post-mortem assessment. They provide information on brain activity and structure that is invaluable to understanding abnormalities associated with neurodegeneration in PD. Among these tools, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is often favored for its safety and spatial resolution. Resting state fMRI research capitalizes on the wealth of information that the brain offers when a person is not performing a motor or cognitive task. It is also a good means to study impaired and heterogeneous populations, such as people with PD. The present article reviews research that applies resting state fMRI to the ongoing hunt for biomarkers of PD non-motor symptoms.

25359225,Gestational stress induces persistent depressive-like behavior and structural modifications within the postpartum nucleus accumbens.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common complication following childbirth experienced by one in every five new mothers. Pregnancy stress enhances vulnerability to PPD and has also been shown to increase depressive-like behavior in postpartum rats. Thus, gestational stress may be an important translational risk factor that can be used to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PPD. Here we examined the effects of gestational stress on depressive-like behavior during the early/mid and late postpartum periods and evaluated whether this was accompanied by altered structural plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region that has been linked to PPD. We show that early/mid (postpartum day 8) postpartum female rats exhibited more depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test as compared with late postpartum females (postpartum day 22). However, 2 weeks of restraint stress during pregnancy increased depressive-like behavior regardless of postpartum timepoint. In addition, dendritic length, branching and spine density on medium spiny neurons in the NAc shell were diminished in postpartum rats that experienced gestational stress although stress-induced reductions in spine density were evident only in early/mid postpartum females. In the NAc core, structural plasticity was not affected by gestational stress but late postpartum females exhibited lower spine density and reduced dendritic length. Overall, these data not only demonstrate structural changes in the NAc across the postpartum period, they also show that postpartum depressive-like behavior following exposure to gestational stress is associated with compromised structural plasticity in the NAc and thus may provide insight into the neural changes that could contribute to PPD.",2014-Dec,The European journal of neuroscience,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2014,YES,sa,How might gestational stress contribute to postpartum depression through structural changes in the nucleus accumbens?,"Gestational stress diminishes dendritic length, branching, and spine density in the nucleus accumbens shell, impairing structural plasticity linked to postpartum depressive-like behavior.","The abstract shows gestational stress reduces structural plasticity in the NAc shell, especially spine density during early/mid postpartum, correlating with increased depressive-like behavior, a hallmark of postpartum depression."
25080852,Retroinverso analogs of spadin display increased antidepressant effects.,"Although depression is the most common mood disorder, only one third of patients are treated with success. Finding new targets, new drugs, and also new drug intake way are the main challenges in the depression field. Several years ago, we identified a new target with the TWIK-related potassium channel-1 (TREK-1) potassium channel, and more recently, we have discovered a peptide of 17 amino acids with antidepressant properties. This peptide, that we called spadin, can be considered as a new concept in antidepressant drug design. Spadin derives from a larger peptide resulting to a posttranslational maturation of sortilin; consequently, spadin can be considered as a natural molecule. Moreover, spadin acts more rapidly than classical antidepressants and does not induce side effects. In this work, we sought analogs of spadin displaying a better affinity on TREK-1 channels and an increased action duration. Analogs were characterized by electrophysiology measurements, by behavioral tests, and by their ability to induce neurogenesis. We identified two retro-inverso peptides that have kept the antidepressant properties of spadin; particularly, they increased the hippocampal neurogenesis after a 4-day treatment. As spadin, these analogs did not induce side effects on either pain, epilepsy processes, or at the cardiac level. Together, our results indicated that spadin retro-inverso peptides could represent new potent antidepressant drugs. As exemplified by spadin in the field of depression, retro-inverso strategies could represent a useful technique for developing new classes of drugs in a number of pathologies.",2015-Feb,Psychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,What is a potential advantage of using retro-inverso peptides targeting TREK-1 channels for the treatment of depression compared to classical antidepressants?,"Retro-inverso peptides act more rapidly, induce hippocampal neurogenesis, and lack side effects such as pain, epilepsy, or cardiac issues.","The abstract highlights that retro-inverso peptides targeting TREK-1 channels show rapid antidepressant effects, promote hippocampal neurogenesis, and avoid side effects commonly associated with classical antidepressants, making them a promising alternative treatment option for depression."

At 4-months postpartum, 214 mothers (145 with a history of childhood abuse or neglect) completed interviews assessing mental health symptoms, positive functioning, resilience and trauma history. Multiple and moderated linear regression with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaires (CTQ) were conducted to assess for main and moderating effects. Resilience, childhood trauma severity, and their interaction predicted postpartum PTSD and MDD. In mothers without childhood maltreatment, PTSD was absent irrespective of CD-RISC scores. However, for those with the highest quartile of CTQ severity, 8% of those with highest resilience in contrast with 58% of those with lowest CD-RISC scores met PTSD diagnostic criteria. Similar, in those with highest resilience, no mothers met criteria for postpartum MDD, irrespective of childhood trauma, while for those with lowest quartile of resilience, 25% with lowest CTQ severity and 68% of those with highest CTQ severity were depressed. The CD-RISC, but not the CTQ, was predictive of postpartum sense of competence. The CD-RISC and the CTQ were predictive of postpartum family functioning, though no moderating influence of resilience on childhood trauma was found. Resilience is associated with reduced psychopathology and improved wellbeing in all mothers. It further serves as a buffer against psychiatric symptoms following childhood trauma. Such findings may assist in identification of those at greatest risk of adverse functioning postpartum, utilization of resilience-enhancing intervention may benefit perinatal wellness, and reduce intergenerational transmission of risk.",2015-Mar-15,Journal of affective disorders,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2014,YES,sa,How does resilience moderate the relationship between childhood maltreatment severity and postpartum major depressive disorder (MDD)?,"High resilience eliminates postpartum MDD risk irrespective of childhood maltreatment severity, while low resilience increases MDD risk, especially in cases of severe maltreatment.","The abstract shows no mothers with high resilience had MDD, regardless of maltreatment, while 68% with low resilience and severe maltreatment met MDD criteria, highlighting resilience as a protective factor."
25100614,Examining multiracial youth in context: ethnic identity development and mental health outcomes.,"Although multiracial individuals are the fastest growing population in the United States, research on the identity development of multiracial adolescents remains scant. This study explores the relationship between ethnic identity, its components (affirmation, exploration), and mental health outcomes (anxiety, depressive symptoms) within the contexts of schools for multiracial adolescents. The participants were multiracial and monoracial minority and majority high school students (n = 4,766; 54.6% female). Among the participants, 88.1% were Caucasian, 7.4% were African American, and 4.5% were multiracial. The research questions examined the relationship between ethnic identity exploration and affirmation on mental health outcomes and explored the role school context plays in this relationship. The findings suggested that multiracial youth experience more exploration and less affirmation than African Americans, but more than Caucasians. In addition, multiracial youth were found to have higher levels of mental health issues than their monoracial minority and majority peers. Specifically, multiracial youth had higher levels of depressive symptoms than their African American and Caucasian counterparts. Multiracial and Caucasian youth had similar levels of anxiety but these levels were significantly higher than African Americans. School diversity did not influence mental health outcomes for multiracial youth. These findings provide insight into the experiences of multiracial youth and underscore the importance of further investigating factors that contribute to their mental health outcomes.",2014-Oct,Journal of youth and adolescence,Journal Article,2014,YES,sa,How might differences in ethnic identity exploration and affirmation contribute to depressive symptoms in multiracial adolescents compared to monoracial minority and majority peers?,Greater exploration and less affirmation in multiracial adolescents may contribute to higher depressive symptoms compared to monoracial peers.,"The abstract indicates multiracial youth experience more exploration and less affirmation than others, and this is associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, emphasizing a potential link between identity development and mental health outcomes."
24699796,The Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale: development and preliminary validation.,"The purpose of this study is to develop a scale (Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale, PASS) to screen for a broad range of problematic anxiety symptoms which is sensitive to how anxiety presents in perinatal women and is suitable to use in a variety of settings including antenatal clinics, inpatient and outpatient hospital and mental health treatment settings. Women who attended a tertiary obstetric hospital in the state of Western Australia antenatally or postpartum (n = 437) completed the PASS and other commonly used measures of depression and anxiety. Factor analysis was used to examine factor structure, and ROC analysis was used to evaluate performance as a screening tool. The PASS was significantly correlated with other measures of depression and anxiety. Principal component analyses (PCA) suggested a four-factor structure addressing symptoms of (1) acute anxiety and adjustment, (2) general worry and specific fears, (3) perfectionism, control and trauma and (4) social anxiety. The four subscales and total scale demonstrated high to excellent reliabilities. At the optimal cutoff score for detecting anxiety as determined by ROC analyses, the PASS identified 68 % of women with a diagnosed anxiety disorder. This was compared to the EPDS anxiety subscale which detected 36 % of anxiety disorders. The PASS is an acceptable, valid and useful screening tool for the identification of risk of significant anxiety in women in the perinatal period.",2014-Oct,Archives of women's mental health,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,"Which screening tool is more effective at identifying anxiety disorders in perinatal women: the EPDS anxiety subscale or the PASS, and why?","The PASS is more effective, identifying 68% of anxiety disorders compared to 36% by the EPDS anxiety subscale.","The abstract states the PASS has higher sensitivity in detecting anxiety disorders in perinatal women, supported by ROC analysis and comparison to the EPDS anxiety subscale."
25092985,Lower serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are associated with failure to achieve remission in patients with major depression after escitalopram treatment.,"Remission, the primary goal of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), is the absence of significant signs or symptoms and the return to a state of normal functioning. A recent study found that the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increased after antidepressant treatment in remitted patients. This study evaluated serum BDNF levels in MDD patients with chronic maintenance treatment, and compared these between remission and nonremission groups. Serum BDNF levels were measured in 34 MDD patients and 35 healthy controls. The severity of depression was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D). The MDD patients were divided into remission and nonremission groups according to a cutoff total Ham-D score of either ≤7 or ≤6. Serum BDNF levels differed significantly between the remission, nonremission, and healthy control groups (P<0.05). The Bonferroni post hoc test confirmed that serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in the nonremission group than in the healthy-control group (P<0.05), but did not differ significantly between the remission and healthy-control groups. This study included a small sample, and measured serum BDNF levels in the MDD patients at only one point during the maintenance treatment. This study found that serum BDNF levels during maintenance treatment were lower in MDD patients with failure to achieve remission than in controls, while the remitted subjects had normalized serum BDNF levels. A lower level of serum BDNF during maintenance treatment is associated with failure to achieve remission in patients with major depression. Moreover, serum BDNF levels after chronic antidepressant treatment can be used as a biological marker for detecting nonremission.",2014,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,Journal Article,2014,YES,sa,"What biological marker could indicate failure to achieve remission in patients undergoing chronic antidepressant treatment for major depressive disorder, and how does it compare to healthy controls?",Lower serum BDNF levels; significantly lower in nonremission patients compared to healthy controls.,"The abstract states that serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in nonremission patients than in healthy controls, while remitted patients had normalized levels, making serum BDNF a marker for nonremission."
25338634,Impaired visuocortical discrimination learning of socially conditioned stimuli in social anxiety.,"In search of causative factors of social anxiety disorder (SAD), classical conditioning has been discussed as a potential trigger mechanism for many years. Recent findings suggest that the social relevance of the unconditioned stimulus (US) might play a major role in learning theories of SAD. Thus, this study applied a social conditioning paradigm with disorder-relevant US to examine the electrocortical correlates of affective learning. Twenty-four high socially anxious (HSA) and 23 age- and gender-matched low socially anxious (LSA) subjects were conditioned to 3 different faces flickering at a frequency of 15 Hz which were paired with auditory insults, compliments or neutral comments (US). The face-evoked electrocortical response was measured via steady-state visually evoked potentials and subjective measures of valence and arousal were obtained. Results revealed a significant interaction of social anxiety and conditioning, with LSA showing highest cortical activity to faces paired with insults and lowest activity to faces paired with compliments, while HSA did not differentiate between faces. No group differences were discovered in the affective ratings. The findings indicate a potentially impaired ability of HSA to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant social stimuli, which may constitute a perpetuating factor of SAD.",2015-Jul,Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,How might impaired discrimination between relevant and irrelevant social stimuli contribute to the perpetuation of social anxiety disorder?,"It may prevent individuals from appropriately responding to social cues, leading to generalized fear or avoidance of social situations.","The abstract suggests high socially anxious individuals fail to differentiate between insults, compliments, and neutral stimuli, which may hinder adaptive learning and exacerbate social anxiety symptoms."

25195078,Rumination mediates the relationships between depressed mood and both sleep quality and self-reported health in young adults.,"The psychological mechanisms by which depressed mood can lead to impaired sleep and poorer overall health remain unclear. The goal of this study was to investigate the extent to which a tendency to ruminate accounts for the associations between depressed mood and both sleep quality and self-reported health in 165 healthy young adults. Self-reported assessments of anxiety, depressed mood, rumination, sleep quality, and general health were collected at two different time points approximately 2 months apart. Structural equation modeling revealed that rumination measured at the earlier time point mediated the relationships between depressed mood and both sleep quality and health, all measured at the later time point, in a model that was a good fit to the data overall, χ(2) (50, N = 165) = 103.08, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.08 (0.06-0.10), TLI = 0.91, CFI = 0.94.

24760033,Left and right amygdala - mediofrontal cortical functional connectivity is differentially modulated by harm avoidance.,"The left and right amygdalae are key regions distinctly involved in emotion-regulation processes. Individual differences, such as personality features, may affect the implicated neurocircuits. The lateralized amygdala affective processing linked with the temperament dimension Harm Avoidance (HA) remains poorly understood. Resting state functional connectivity imaging (rsFC) may provide more insight into these neuronal processes. In 56 drug-naive healthy female subjects, we have examined the relationship between the personality dimension HA on lateralized amygdala rsFC. Across all subjects, left and right amygdalae were connected with distinct regions mainly within the ipsilateral hemisphere. Females scoring higher on HA displayed stronger left amygdala rsFC with ventromedial prefrontal cortical (vmPFC) regions involved in affective disturbances. In high HA scorers, we also observed stronger right amygdala rsFC with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which is implicated in negative affect regulation. In healthy females, left and right amygdalae seem implicated in distinct mPFC brain networks related to HA and may represent a vulnerability marker for sensitivity to stress and anxiety (disorders).",2014,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,How might heightened Harm Avoidance (HA) in females influence amygdala-prefrontal connectivity patterns relevant to anxiety disorders?,"Heightened HA in females is associated with stronger left amygdala connectivity to vmPFC and right amygdala connectivity to dmPFC, regions linked to affective disturbances and negative affect regulation.","The abstract highlights that high HA correlates with stronger left amygdala-vmPFC and right amygdala-dmPFC connectivity, which are implicated in stress sensitivity and anxiety vulnerability, key features of anxiety disorders."
24161452,C-reactive protein and cortisol in drug-naïve patients with short-illness-duration first episode major depressive disorder: possible role of cortisol immunomodulatory action at early stage of the disease.,"Hypercortisolemia and low grade systemic inflammation are observed in major depressive disorder (MDD). Studies on markers of systematic inflammation and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation in MDD produce confounded results due to heterogeneity of MDD patients related to illness stages and severity with a large proportion suffering from remitted-recurrent and treatment-resistant/chronic depression with first-episode major depression being underrepresented. This study was designed to examine whether and to what extent CRP is related to baseline cortisol concentrations in a well defined cohort of short-illness-duration first-episode, treatment-naïve MDD patients. The levels of salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) and baseline plasma cortisol concentrations were studied in this cross-sectional case-control study on 20 non-late-life adult, treatment- naïve MDD patients with short-illness-duration first affective episode and in 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Depressed patients showed a basal score in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) higher than 20. No significant difference in CRP concentration between MDD and control groups was found. Significantly higher baseline cortisol (p=0.01) concentration was observed in MDD as compared to controls. Significant positive correlation was found between cortisol and CRP levels both in MDD subjects (r=0.57; p=0.008) and controls (r=0.61; p=0.004). The current study is limited by its cross-sectional design and small sample size.

25093484,Mood disorders in restless legs syndrome (Willis-Ekbom disease).,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a sensorimotor disorder that can result in considerable sleep disruption. This narrative review provides an overview of RLS diagnosis and reports epidemiologic evidence for an association between RLS and mood disorders. Possible links between RLS, sleep disturbances, and mood disorders are considered, and theoretical pathophysiologic pathways are discussed. Finally, pharmacologic therapies for RLS are summarized. A PubMed search was performed using the search term restless legs syndrome in combination with affective/anxiety, antidepressants, anxiety/anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression/depressive disorder, mood/mood disorder, neuropsychiatric, panic/panic disorder, psychiatric disorder, and psychosis. English-language articles published between January 1993 and May 2013 were retrieved. Additional studies were identified from the reference lists of relevant publications. 173 publications were retrieved. Articles related to the association between idiopathic RLS and depression, anxiety, and mood disorders were reviewed. In total, 32 epidemiologic studies were identified. These studies were reviewed in detail and ranked according to quality. Data were extracted on the basis of relevance to the topic. Epidemiologic studies were assessed using 3 parameters: methodology, data quality, and generalizability of the results. Each factor was scored from 1 (high quality) to 4 (low quality), giving a total score of between 3 and 12 for each study. RLS and mood disorders are frequently comorbid.

25201155,The HAPPY study (Holistic Approach to Pregnancy and the first Postpartum Year): design of a large prospective cohort study.,"The HAPPY study is a large prospective longitudinal cohort study in which pregnant women (N ≈ 2,500) are followed during the entire pregnancy and the whole first year postpartum. The study collects a substantial amount of psychological and physiological data investigating all kinds of determinants that might interfere with general well-being during pregnancy and postpartum, with special attention to the effect of maternal mood, pregnancy-related somatic symptoms (including nausea and vomiting (NVP) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) symptoms), thyroid function, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) on pregnancy outcome of mother and foetus. During pregnancy, participants receive questionnaires at 12, 22 and 32 weeks of gestation. Apart from a previous obstetric history, demographic features, distress symptoms, and pregnancy-related somatic symptoms are assessed. Furthermore, obstetrical data of the obstetric record form and ultrasound data are collected during pregnancy. At 12 and 30 weeks, thyroid function is assessed by blood analysis of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab), as well as HCG. Also, depression is assessed with special focus on the two key symptoms: depressed mood and anhedonia. After childbirth, cord blood, neonatal heel screening results and all obstetrical data with regard to start of labour, mode of delivery and complications are collected. Moreover, mothers receive questionnaires at one week, six weeks, four, eight, and twelve months postpartum, to investigate recovery after pregnancy and delivery, including postpartum mood changes, emotional distress, feeding and development of the newborn. The key strength of this large prospective cohort study is the holistic (multifactorial) approach on perinatal well-being combined with a longitudinal design with measurements during all trimesters of pregnancy and the whole first year postpartum, taking into account two physiological possible markers of complaints and symptoms throughout gestation: thyroid function and HCG. The HAPPY study is among the first to investigate within one design physiological and psychological aspects of NVP and CTS symptoms during pregnancy.

25453710,Separation anxiety disorder across the lifespan: DSM-5 lifts age restriction on diagnosis.,"DSM-5 has lifted the age criterion in the definition of separation anxiety disorder thereby overturning the long-standing convention of restricting the diagnosis to childhood. Previously, adults with separation anxiety symptoms were assigned to other conventional categories such as panic disorder, agoraphobia or generalized anxiety disorder. Over the past two decades, an evolving body of research has identified separation anxiety disorder in adulthood, with 20-40% of adult psychiatric outpatients being assigned that diagnosis. In the US, the lifetime prevalence of the disorder in adulthood is 6.6%. The removal of the age restriction on diagnosis has important implications for clinical practice. Whereas parents (particularly mothers) of children with separation anxiety disorder commonly attracted the diagnosis of agoraphobia, the latter are more likely now to be diagnosed with the adult form of separation anxiety disorder, focusing attention on the importance of intervening with both members of the dyad to overcome mutual reinforcement of symptoms. In addition, adults with separation anxiety disorder have been found to manifest high levels of disability and they tend to show a poor response to conventional psychological and pharmacological treatments. There is an urgent need therefore to devise novel psychological and pharmacological interventions for the adult form of the disorder. The reformulation of separation anxiety disorder in DSM-5 therefore requires a paradigm shift in which clinicians are alerted to identifying and treating the condition in all age groups. Research across countries is needed to examine the new formulation of separation anxiety disorder amongst populations of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.",2014-Oct,Asian journal of psychiatry,Journal Article,2014,YES,sa,"What diagnostic shift in DSM-5 allows clinicians to identify separation anxiety disorder in adults, and why is this significant for clinical practice?","DSM-5 removed the age restriction for diagnosing separation anxiety disorder, enabling its identification in adults, which is significant due to its high prevalence, associated disability, and poor response to conventional treatments.","The abstract highlights that DSM-5 lifted the age limit for separation anxiety disorder, revealing its prevalence and impact in adults, necessitating new treatment strategies and dyadic interventions."
25530669,Examining Spouse/Partner Presence as a Moderator in the Relationship between Mental Health Symptoms and Alcohol Use in OEF/OIF Veterans.,"Veterans from the conflicts in Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom; OEF) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom; OIF) have reported elevated rates of alcohol consumption, and greater depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are associated with increased alcohol use. Presence of a spouse/partner, which has been associated with reduced drinking, may buffer the relationship between mental health symptoms and alcohol consumption. To examine this hypothesis, the current study utilized baseline survey data from OEF/OIF veterans (N=325) enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention. Spouse/partner presence moderated the relationship between depression symptoms and alcohol consumption such that depression was positively associated with drinking for veterans <i>without</i> a spouse/partner.

24982640,"Overexpression of Adenosine A2A Receptors in Rats: Effects on Depression, Locomotion, and Anxiety.","Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) are a sub-type of receptors enriched in basal ganglia, activated by the neuromodulator adenosine, which interact with dopamine D2 receptors. Although this reciprocal antagonistic interaction is well-established in motor function, the outcome in dopamine-related behaviors remains uncertain, in particular in depression and anxiety. We have demonstrated an upsurge of A2AR associated to aging and chronic stress. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease patients present A2AR accumulation in cortical areas together with depressive signs. We now tested the impact of overexpressing A2AR in forebrain neurons on dopamine-related behavior, namely depression. Adult male rats overexpressing human A2AR under the control of CaMKII promoter [Tg(CaMKII-hA2AR)] and aged-matched wild-types (WT) of the same strain (Sprague-Dawley) were studied. The forced swimming test (FST), sucrose preference test (SPT), and the open-field test (OFT) were performed to evaluate behavioral despair, anhedonia, locomotion, and anxiety. Tg(CaMKII-hA2AR) animals spent more time floating and less time swimming in the FST and presented a decreased sucrose preference at 48 h in the SPT. They also covered higher distances in the OFT and spent more time in the central zone than the WT.

The aim of this study was to determine the psychiatric state and health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children and adolescents with AA, as well as their relationships with clinical parameters. The sample consisted of 74 children with AA aged 8-18 years. Questionnaires were used to evaluate the psychiatric status and HRQL of the patients. The study and control groups were divided into child and adolescent groups to exclude the effect of puberty on psychological condition. In the child group, patients had higher state anxiety and trait anxiety scores; they also had lower parent-rated psychosocial and total area HRQL scores than the controls did. In addition, the depression score was prone to show a positive relationship with having AA in the children. In the adolescent group, however, only the state anxiety score had a significant association with AA. All of the parent-rated HRQL scores were also prone to being lower compared with controls in this age group. Regarding determinants of HRQL, prolonged disease duration and later disease onset had positive effects, whereas severity of scalp involvement, trait anxiety and depression had negative effects, for the sample as a whole.

24635739,The distinct role of performing euthanasia on depression and suicide in veterinarians.,"Veterinarians are more likely to experience mood disorders and suicide than other occupational groups (Fritschi, Morrison, Shirangi & Day, 2009; Platt, Hawton, Simkin, & Mellanby, 2010). The performance of euthanasia has been implicated as contributing determinately to the prevalence of suicide risk and psychological distress in veterinarians (Bartram & Baldwin, 2008, 2010). In contrast, the application of psychological approaches would suggest a possible protective role for euthanasia administration. This paper is the first to investigate the association between euthanasia-administration frequency and depressed mood and suicide risk. A cross-sectional survey sampled 540 Australia-registered veterinarians (63.8% women), ranging in age from 23 to 74. Results revealed that the administration of objectionable euthanasia (i.e., euthanasia that the veterinarian disagreed with) was not related to our mental health variables. In contrast, overall euthanasia frequency had a weak positive linear relationship with depression. Moreover, overall euthanasia frequency moderated the impact of depression on suicide risk. The nature of this moderation suggested that average frequency per week of performing euthanasia attenuated the relationship between depressed mood and suicide risk. The implications of these findings and directions for further research are discussed.",2014-Apr,Journal of occupational health psychology,Journal Article,2014,YES,sa,How might the frequency of performing euthanasia influence the relationship between depression and suicide risk in veterinarians?,Higher euthanasia frequency may attenuate the relationship between depression and suicide risk.,"The abstract indicates that euthanasia frequency moderates the depression-suicide risk relationship, with higher frequency weakening this association, suggesting a potential protective role in mitigating suicide risk among depressed veterinarians."

25175097,Integrated collaborative care for major depression comorbid with a poor prognosis cancer (SMaRT Oncology-3): a multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with lung cancer.,"The management of depression in patients with poor prognosis cancers, such as lung cancer, creates specific challenges. We aimed to assess the efficacy of an integrated treatment programme for major depression in patients with lung cancer compared with usual care. Symptom Management Research Trials (SMaRT) Oncology-3 is a parallel-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. We enrolled patients with lung cancer and major depression from three cancer centres and their associated clinics in Scotland, UK. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the depression care for people with lung cancer treatment programme or usual care by a database software algorithm that used stratification (by trial centre) and minimisation (by age, sex, and cancer type) with allocation concealment. Depression care for people with lung cancer is a manualised, multicomponent collaborative care treatment that is systematically delivered by a team of cancer nurses and psychiatrists in collaboration with primary care physicians. Usual care is provided by primary care physicians. The primary outcome was depression severity (on the Symptom Checklist Depression Scale [SCL-20], range 0-4) averaged over the patient's time in the trial (up to a maximum of 32 weeks). Trial statisticians and data collection staff were masked to treatment allocation, but patients and clinicians could not be masked to the allocations. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN75905964. 142 participants were recruited between Jan 5, 2009, and Sept 9, 2011; 68 were randomly allocated to depression care for people with lung cancer and 74 to usual care. 43 (30%) of 142 patients had died by 32 weeks, all of which were cancer-related deaths. No intervention-related serious adverse events occurred. 131 (92%) of 142 patients provided outcome data (59 in the depression care for people with lung cancer group and 72 in the usual care group) and were included in the intention-to-treat primary analysis. Average depression severity was significantly lower in patients allocated to depression care for people with lung cancer (mean score on the SCL-20 1·24 [SD 0·64]) than in those allocated to usual care (mean score 1·61 [SD 0·58]); difference -0·38 (95% CI -0·58 to -0·18); standardised mean difference -0·62 (95% CI -0·94 to -0·29). Self-rated depression improvement, anxiety, quality of life, role functioning, perceived quality of care, and proportion of patients achieving a 12-week treatment response were also significantly better in the depression care for people with lung cancer group than in the usual care group. Our findings suggest that major depression can be treated effectively in patients with a poor prognosis cancer; integrated depression care for people with lung cancer was substantially more efficacious than was usual care. Larger trials are now needed to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this care programme in this patient population, and further adaptation of the treatment will be necessary to address the unmet needs of patients with major depression and even shorter life expectancy.

24653686,"Contributions of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus in the regulation of stress, motivation, and mood.","The purpose of this review is to describe how the function and connections of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (Pa) may play a role in the regulation of stress and negative emotional behavior. Located in the dorsal midline thalamus, the Pa is heavily innervated by serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine (DA), corticotropin-releasing hormone, and orexins (ORX), and is the only thalamic nucleus connected to the group of structures comprising the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and infralimbic/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). These neurotransmitter systems and structures are involved in regulating motivation and mood, and display abnormal functioning in several psychiatric disorders including anxiety, substance use, and major depressive disorders (MDD). Furthermore, rodent studies show that the Pa is consistently and potently activated following a variety of stressors and has a unique role in regulating responses to chronic stressors. These observations provide a compelling rationale for investigating the Pa in the link between stress and negative emotional behavior, and for including the Pa in the neural pathways of stress-related psychiatric disorders.",2014,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,Journal Article; Review,2014,YES,sa,Which thalamic nucleus is uniquely connected to structures implicated in mood regulation and displays abnormal functioning in major depressive and anxiety disorders?,Paraventricular thalamic nucleus (Pa),"The Pa is the only thalamic nucleus connected to the amygdala, BNST, NAcc, and sgACC, all of which are involved in mood regulation and display dysfunction in depression and anxiety disorders."
24463888,Antidepressant-like effect of celecoxib piroxicam in rat models of depression.,"Beyond the current hypothesis of depression, several new biological substrates have been proposed for this disorder. The present study investigated whether the anti-inflammatory drugs celecoxib and piroxicam have antidepressant activity in animal models of depression. After acute administration, we observed antidepressant-like effects of celecoxib (10 mg/kg) and piroxicam (10 mg/kg) in the modified forced swim test in rats. Piroxicam increased serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the hippocampus. Prolonged (21-day) treatment with celecoxib (10 mg/kg) and piroxicam (10 mg/kg) rescued sucrose preference in a chronic mild stress model of depression. Additionally, the chronic mild stress-induced reduction of hippocampal glutathione was prevented by treatment with celecoxib and piroxicam. Superoxide dismutase in the hippocampus was increased after chronic mild stress compared with the non-stressed saline group. The non-stressed celecoxib and piroxicam groups and stressed piroxicam group exhibited an increase in hippocampal superoxide dismutase activity compared with the stressed saline group. Lipid hydroperoxide was increased in the stressed group treated with vehicle and non-stressed group treated with imipramine but not in the stressed groups treated with celecoxib and piroxicam. These results suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of anti-inflammatory drugs might be attributable to enhanced antioxidant defenses and attenuated oxidative stress in the hippocampus.",2014-Jun,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,What potential mechanism might explain the antidepressant-like effects of certain anti-inflammatory drugs in a chronic mild stress model of depression?,Enhanced antioxidant defenses and reduced oxidative stress in the hippocampus.,"The abstract indicates that celecoxib and piroxicam prevented hippocampal glutathione reduction, increased superoxide dismutase activity, and mitigated lipid hydroperoxide elevation, suggesting their antidepressant-like effects are linked to improved antioxidant defenses and reduced oxidative stress in the hippocampus."
24587318,The impact of individual depressive symptoms on impairment of psychosocial functioning.,"Previous studies have established that scores on Major Depressive Disorder scales are correlated with measures of impairment of psychosocial functioning. It remains unclear, however, whether individual depressive symptoms vary in their effect on impairment, and if so, what the magnitude of these differences might be. We analyzed data from 3,703 depressed outpatients in the first treatment stage of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. Participants reported on the severity of 14 depressive symptoms, and stated to what degree their depression impaired psychosocial functioning (in general, and in the five domains work, home management, social activities, private activities, and close relationships). We tested whether symptoms differed in their associations with impairment, estimated unique shared variances of each symptom with impairment to assess the degree of difference, and examined whether symptoms had variable impacts across impairment domains. Our results show that symptoms varied substantially in their associations with impairment, and contributed to the total explained variance in a range from 0.7% (hypersomnia) to 20.9% (sad mood). Furthermore, symptoms had significantly different impacts on the five impairment domains. Overall, sad mood and concentration problems had the highest unique associations with impairment and were among the most debilitating symptoms in all five domains. Our findings are in line with a growing chorus of voices suggesting that symptom sum-scores obfuscate relevant differences between depressed patients and that substantial rewards will come from close attention to individual depression symptoms.",2014,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2014,YES,sa,"Which two depressive symptoms have the strongest unique associations with psychosocial impairment across multiple life domains, and why might this be clinically relevant?",Sad mood and concentration problems; they have the highest unique associations with impairment and are among the most debilitating symptoms across all five domains.,"The abstract highlights that sad mood and concentration problems uniquely explain the most variance in psychosocial impairment, suggesting these symptoms disproportionately affect functioning and may require targeted interventions in treatment planning."

(2) To address the question of directionality in these longitudinal relationships. (3) To investigate the effects of the intervention on levels of social support. Eighty-nine women were enrolled in the study, and randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition. They were evaluated with the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Symptom Checklist (SCL) -90-R, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) at three time periods: baseline (pre-intervention), 1 year post-intervention and 2 years post-intervention. Relationships between social support and the psychiatric measures were evaluated both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Cross-sectionally, there were strong associations at each time period between being diagnosed with a DSM-III-R Axis I disorder and having less adequate perceived social support from both close relationships and more distant social ties. Initial levels of psychiatric symptoms on the BDI and GSI were better predictors of later social support than initial social support variables were of later psychiatric symptoms. Participation in the group intervention did not result in changes in social support at 1 or 2 years post-intervention. Cross-sectionally, there was a strong relationship between social support and psychiatric morbidity in these patients with early-stage breast cancer. Longitudinally, it appeared that although social support influenced psychiatric symptomatology somewhat, the influence of psychiatric symptoms on social support was greater.

Participants are Catholic clergy members who were aged > or =65 years and who did not have clinical evidence of AD. During a 7-year period, they underwent annual clinical evaluations that included clinical classification of AD and detailed cognitive function testing from which global and specific measures of cognition were derived. Number of depressive symptoms was assessed at baseline with a modified, 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The association of CES-D score with incident AD, using proportional hazards models, and cognitive decline, using random effects models, was examined. At baseline, participants reported an average of about one depressive symptom on the CES-D scale (range, 0 to 8). During the 7 years of follow-up, 108 persons developed AD. In analyses that controlled for selected demographic and clinical variables including baseline level of cognitive function, CES-D score was associated with both risk of AD and rate of cognitive decline. For each depressive symptom, risk of developing AD increased by an average of 19%, and annual decline on a global cognitive measure increased by an average of 24%.

12183688,Brain reward system activity in major depression and comorbid nicotine dependence.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and nicotine dependence are highly comorbid. MDD patients may use nicotine to ameliorate depressive symptoms. The pathophysiology of the comorbidity of these two disorders is unknown. We hypothesized that a dysfunctional dopaminergic brain reward system (BRS) might be a neurobiological link between MDD and nicotine dependence and that smoking modulates the activity of the BRS by enhancing dopaminergic activity and relieving some depressive symptoms. Eighteen nicotine-dependent, nonmedicated subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) diagnosis of MDD and 16 nicotine-dependent, control subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized parallel study. A single 30-mg oral dose of d-amphetamine (d-amph) was used to release dopamine and probe the activity of the BRS. The d-amph-mediated physiological and rewarding effects were assessed at baseline and post-treatment using standardized and validated questionnaires. Our results show that d-amph significantly increased blood pressure (p < 0.001). Subjective rewarding d-amph effects increased in both groups. Negative subjective effects were reported while on placebo during nonsmoking sessions. A significant correlation between depression severity (Hamilton depression scale) and d-amph rewarding effects was found in MDD smoker subjects (Addiction Research Center Inventory composite: r = 0.89, p < 0.000; profile of mood states composite: r = 0.71, p < 0.003; and visual analog scales composite: r = 0.78, p < 0.005). These data show that smoking did not modify the response to d-amph in MDD or control subjects, but decreased overall negative mood state during placebo sessions. Severity of depression was significantly correlated with increased rewarding effects of d-amph. Thus, although the BRS may be dysfunctional in MDD subjects, chronic nicotine use does not modify response to d-amph.",2002-Sep,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2002,YES,sa,"In patients with major depressive disorder who are nicotine-dependent, how does the severity of depression correlate with the rewarding effects of dopamine release induced by d-amphetamine?",Depression severity positively correlates with increased rewarding effects of d-amphetamine.,"The abstract states that higher depression severity in nicotine-dependent MDD patients significantly correlates with increased rewarding effects of d-amphetamine, as measured by validated scales (e.g., r = 0.89, p < 0.000)."
11964139,Exploring the relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction in aging men.,"Normal sexual function is a biopsychosocial process; sexual dysfunction almost always has organic and psychological components and requires multidisciplinary, goal-directed evaluation and treatment. Factors such as aging, declining testosterone levels, medical illness, certain medications. and comorbid depressive illness can contribute to sexual dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is one of the more common male sexual dysfunctions encountered in the clinical setting. Comorbidity between erectile dysfunction and depressive illness is high, but the causal relationship is unclear. The psychosocial distress that often accompanies erectile dysfunction might stimulate the development of depressive illness, or, as some data suggest, depression might cause erectile dysfunction. This article reviews the literature on the relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction, as well as the design of a new study that may provide some answers, and concludes that erectile dysfunction is a common, treatable condition that may cause or be the result of depression. Recent data suggest that sildenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction in men with comorbid depression. Erectile dysfunction should be considered a multifactorial condition that may require a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, especially when depression is present.",2002,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,2002,YES,sa,"What is one plausible bidirectional relationship between erectile dysfunction and clinical depression, and how might this impact treatment planning?","Erectile dysfunction may cause psychosocial distress leading to depression, or depression may contribute to erectile dysfunction via biological or psychological pathways.","The abstract states erectile dysfunction can result in psychosocial distress linked to depression or be caused by depression, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary treatment approach addressing both conditions."
11959085,Antidepressant activity of memory-enhancing drugs in the reduction of submissive behavior model.,"The present study tests the activity of nootropic drugs in a behavioral test linked to depression. This test measures the reduction of submissive behavior in a competition test as the relative success of two food-restricted rats to gain access to a feeder. Nootropic drugs tested include piracetam (2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide), aniracetam (1-(4-methoxybenzoyl)-2-pyrrolidinone), the Ampakine, Ampalex, 1-(quinoxalin-6-ylcarbonyl)piperidine, and analogs were compared to the antidepressants, fluoxetine ((+/-)-N-methyl-gamma-(4-[trifluoromethyl]phenoxy)-benzenepropanamine) and desimpramine (5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-propanamine, 10,11-dihydro-N-methyl-, monohydrochloride), while the anxiolytic diazepam (7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one) served as a control. Drugs were given intraperitoneally for 3 weeks. The antidepressant and nootropic drugs reduced submissive behavior over time. The effect was dose dependent as measured for fluoxetine and Ampakines. The reduction of submissive behavior by Ampakines gradually faded after cessation of treatment and had a more rapid onset of activity (during the 1st week of treatment) than fluoxetine (after 2 weeks). The results suggest that Ampakines may have antidepressant activity.

However, their functional state has often been disregarded. The aim of the study was to investigate whether depressed patients show abnormalities in the function of the 5-HT(2A) receptor pathway in platelets. The percentage of serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was assessed in 30 untreated patients with major depressive disorder and in 15 controls. Since 5-HT(2A) platelet receptors mediate the serotonin-induced platelet aggregation response, this index was used as a measure of the functional status of the platelet 5-HT(2A) receptor pathway. There was no significant difference in the percentage of serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation to ADP between depressed patients and controls. No correlation with the severity of depression, as assessed by the Hamilton scale, was found. The results showed no consistent changes in the platelet aggregating responses to serotonin in the depressed patients.

12388965,Mood disturbance in pregnancy and the mode of delivery.,"In prior studies, mood disturbance has been associated with poor obstetric outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine whether depression during pregnancy is associated with a higher frequency of cesarean or assisted vaginal delivery. A mood disorders questionnaire, which included the standardized Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), was offered to all antenatal patients in their early third trimester from January 1996 to December 1999 at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Maternal demographics and pregnancy outcome data were collected from a computerized database on 1697 patients who completed the surveys. A CES-D score of 16 or higher was considered to indicate significant depressive symptoms. Rates of cesarean section and assisted vaginal delivery in women with and without scores of 16 or higher were compared by using the chi(2) test. Of the study population, 264 women (15.6%) had CES-D scores of 16 or higher. Among all subjects, the cesarean section rate was 24.0%, and the assisted vaginal delivery rate was 10.0%. There was no statistically significant difference between the rate of cesarean section (26.5% vs 23.6%) or assisted vaginal delivery (8.0% vs 10.4%) in women with and without elevated CES-D scores (P =.34). These findings did not change when nulliparous and multiparous patients were analyzed separately, when the definition of patients at risk for depression was expanded to include women who indicated current or past use of antidepressants or when the cutoff CES-D score criteria was increased to 19 or 25.

11866321,Evidence of an early information processing speed deficit in unipolar major depression.,"Slowing of the speed of information processing has been reported in geriatric depression, but it is not clear if the impairment is present in younger patients, if motor retardation is responsible, or if antidepressant medications play a role. Twenty unmedicated unipolar depressed inpatients were compared with 19 medicated depressed in-patients and 20 age-, sex- and verbal IQ-matched controls on inspection time (IT), a measure of speed of information processing that does not require a speeded motor response. We also examined the relationship between IT and current mood and length of depressive illness. Unmedicated depressed patients showed slowing of information processing speed when compared to both medicated depressed patients and controls. The latter two groups were not significantly different from each other. Slowing of IT was not associated with current mood, but was negatively correlated with length of illness since first episode. No differences in IT were found between patients receiving medication with anticholinergic effects and patients receiving medication with no anticholinergic effects. The findings indicate that unipolar depression is associated with a slowing of speed of information processing in younger patients who have not received antidepressant medication. This does not appear to be a result of motor slowing.",2002-Feb,Psychological medicine,Journal Article,2002,YES,sa,How does the length of depressive illness relate to the speed of information processing in unipolar depression?,Longer depressive illness duration is associated with slower information processing speed.,"The abstract reports a negative correlation between inspection time (a measure of information processing speed) and the length of depressive illness since the first episode, indicating slower processing with longer illness duration."
11918513,Treatment of resistant depression by adding noradrenergic agents to lithium augmentation of SSRIs.,"To examine the efficacy of second-line augmentation with noradrenergic antidepressants (NAs) in depressed patients who partially responded to lithium augmentation of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Six patients with major depression or double depression (major depression and dysthymia) who were partially responsive to lithium and SSRI treatment were given either bupropion or desipramine, in an open clinical manner. Improvement was determined and rated by a psychiatrist based on clinical judgment guided by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale and by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) as described in Axis V in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Among the 6 depressed patients with partial remission (much improved in symptoms and moderate functional improvement: CGI score 2, GAF score 51-60) while taking the SSRI and lithium combination, 2 showed complete remission (very much improved in symptoms and good functioning: CGI 1, GAF 80-100) and 3 achieved near-complete remission (very much improved in symptoms and significant functional recovery: CGI 1, GAF 61-80) when given either bupropion or desipramine. One patient did not show any additional clinical or functional improvement. Second-line augmentation with bupropion was better tolerated than desipramine. This clinical observation suggests that second-line augmentation with NAs may be a viable option to optimize recovery in depressed patients with a partial response to lithium augmentation of SSRIs.",2002-Apr,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Case Reports; Journal Article,2002,YES,sa,"In patients with major depression partially responsive to SSRI and lithium, which noradrenergic antidepressant is better tolerated as a second-line augmentation option and why?",Bupropion is better tolerated than desipramine.,The abstract states that second-line augmentation with bupropion was better tolerated than desipramine in depressed patients partially responsive to SSRI and lithium treatment.

The influence of RHYTHMS, an information and ongoing interactive program designed by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, to address patient adherence to sertraline therapy was evaluated in a primary care setting using a randomized, double-blind, parallel group controlled trial over 29 weeks. Remission was the primary outcome evaluated. At study completion, no statistically significance between group differences was noted for remission rates, treatment adherence or mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score.

The results demonstrate the multifaceted nature of self-focused attention and elucidate major controversies in the field. Overall, self-focus was associated with negative affect. Several moderators qualified this relationship. Self-focus and negative affect were more strongly related in clinical and female-dominated samples. Rumination yielded stronger effect sizes than nonruminative self-focus. Self-focus on positive self-aspects and following a positive event were related to lower negative affect. Most important, an interaction between foci of self-attention and form of negative affect was found: Private self-focus was more strongly associated with depression and generalized anxiety, whereas public self-focus was more strongly associated with social anxiety.",2002-Jul,Psychological bulletin,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis,2002,YES,sa,How does the type of self-focused attention influence the association with depression versus social anxiety?,"Private self-focus is more strongly associated with depression, while public self-focus is more strongly associated with social anxiety.","The abstract specifies that private self-focus correlates more strongly with depression and generalized anxiety, while public self-focus has a stronger association with social anxiety, emphasizing the role of different self-attention types in these disorders."
11888261,Comparative bioethics in bipolar and epilepsy research.,"AEDs are increasingly evaluated for efficacy in bipolar disorders utilizing double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as required by the FDA. However, the risk to patients is under-estimated in trial design. Bipolar depression has a significant risk for suicide; bipolar episodes can lead to kindling with increased long-term morbidity; rapid regression may occur during the placebo phase or during dose ranging trials with resultant active suicide status. The associated risks mandate that the ethics of FDA-required protocols are addressed. Comparative analysis and literature review of bipolar and epilepsy research designs. In psychiatry, all INDs require RCTs for approval. In epilepsy, AEDs are initially approved as add-on agents only. Once AEDs have demonstrated add-on efficacy, cross-over studies comparing active AEDs, sub-optimal dosing paradigms, new-onset, and pre-surgical inpatient placebo trials are utilized to prove efficacy of the new AED in monotherapy. Ethical considerations to avoid seizures and to minimize risks to subjects have led to newer clinical trial designs. The FDA initially requires add-on studies with new AEDs due to the risk of seizures during the placebo phase. The author argues that bipolar research warrants similar add-on studies to prove efficacy because the risk of suicide and increased long-term morbidity in the bipolar population is as significant as the risk of seizures in the epilepsy population. Although the number of patients needed to prove statistical efficacy would increase, the safety of such research would also markedly increase. The author further concludes that with the risk of suicide during bipolar research, ethical considerations require increased frequency of patient contact with a significant other co-signing the informed consent for research and serving as a contact for the coordinator.",2002-Jan,Seizure,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review,2002,YES,sa,What ethical modification to clinical trial design is recommended to minimize suicide risk during bipolar depression research?,Use add-on studies instead of placebo-controlled monotherapy trials.,"The abstract argues that, akin to epilepsy trials, add-on studies should be used in bipolar research to reduce suicide risk, as placebo phases or dose-ranging trials increase the risk of active suicide status and long-term morbidity."

During an initial evaluation, participants were asked to describe the content of their current worries, and the examining psychiatrist rated the frequency and intensity of these topics. During the following year, the investigators interviewed the participants on a monthly basis assessing the intensity and frequency of original worries, intensity and frequency of new worries, overall worry level, and general anxiety level. Analysis of this longitudinal data indicated level of overall worry and anxiety remained fairly stable over a 12-month period. Although the intensity and frequency of original worries decreased over time, few original worry topics completely remitted. In fact, at the end of the 12-month monitoring period, worry content identified at baseline continued to account for over 65% of the overall worry variance.

One-week continuous recordings were made to record illumination exposure and to infer 24-hour sleep patterns from wrist activity. Recordings took place during normal home and community activities. Complete data of 154 postmenopausal women, mean age 66.7, were selected from a larger study of participants in the Women's Health Initiative. Illumination in lux was averaged for 4 hours before bedtime and over 24 hours. Mood was measured using a brief eight-item screen. Illumination in the 4 hours before bedtime was quite dim: median 24 lux. Nevertheless, evening light exposure was not significantly related to sleep amount (in bed or out of bed) sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake within sleep, or mood. In contrast, the overall amount of light throughout the 24 hours was negatively correlated with sleep latency, wake within sleep, and depressed mood. Low evening lighting does not appear to be a crucial factor in sleep and mood disturbances of aging, but overall lighting may contribute to these disturbances.",2002-Apr,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2002,YES,sa,"How might overall daily light exposure influence depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women, and what sleep-related factors could mediate this effect?","Lower overall daily light exposure correlates with increased depressive symptoms, potentially mediated by longer sleep latency and more wakefulness during sleep.","The abstract indicates that lower 24-hour light exposure is negatively correlated with depressive mood, sleep latency, and wake during sleep, suggesting that disrupted sleep patterns may mediate the relationship between light exposure and mood disturbances."
12489699,Anxiety and poor glycemic control: a meta-analytic review of the literature.,"To determine whether anxiety is associated with poor glycemic control in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. MEDLINE, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases were used to locate studies that measured the association of anxiety with glycemic control. Meta-analytic procedures were used to convert the findings to a common metric, compute effect sizes (ES), and statistically analyze the collective data. The search procedures identified 12 studies, 11 (92 percent) of which satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In this overall group, anxiety was not associated with glycemic control (p = 0.19), although the ES was marginally statistically significant (ES = .09, 95 percent CI = 0.04 to 0.14). In studies that determined anxiety from diagnostic interviews, anxiety was associated with hyperglycemia (p = 0.003) and the ES was also statistically significant (ES: 0.25, 95 percent CI = 0.10 to 0.38).

More recently attention has focused on glutamatergic system. Both preclinical and clinical studies, showing antidepressant-like actions of compounds which reduce transmission at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, indicate possible involvement of glutamatergic system in the etiology of depression. Since glutamatergic transmission is controlled not only by ionotropic but also by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), their involvement in the etiology and the therapy of depression was also postulated. Recent studies, showing that antidepressant treatment may influence mGlu receptors, together with the findings that group I mGluR antagonists, may possess antidepressant-like action, support this hypothesis.",2002,Polish journal of pharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",2002,YES,error,,,RetryError[<Future at 0x1427c44d0 state=finished raised BadRequestError>]

12527473,Neuroanatomical substrates involved in the anxiogenic-like effect of acute fluoxetine treatment.,"An initial exacerbation of anxiety can be observed in animals and humans treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The neurobiological substrates and mechanism(s) underlying this effect are not clear. We used Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation to investigate effects of acute fluoxetine treatment in rats submitted to two different models of emotional stress, airjet and immobilization. Exposure to both stressors induced Fos expression in various brain regions implicated in fear/anxiety mechanisms. Acute treatment with 5 mg/kg fluoxetine facilitated airjet-induced escape responses and enhanced the airjet-, as well as immobilization-induced Fos expression exclusively in the locus coeruleus (LC), but not in other areas including the amygdala, hypothalamus or septum. Fluoxetine also facilitated airjet-induced noradrenaline efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex, a projection area of LC noradrenergic neurons. A higher dose of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) did not change escape responses and had no effect on stress-induced Fos expression in the LC, but decreased airjet-induced Fos expression in the medial amygdala. The results indicate that anxiogenic effects of acute fluoxetine treatment occur in a specific dose range and can be mimicked by exacerbation of escape responses in the airjet model. Furthermore, facilitation of escape responses by fluoxetine is linked to enhanced activity in the LC/noradrenaline system.",2002-Dec,Neuropharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2002,YES,sa,What neurobiological mechanism might explain the initial exacerbation of anxiety symptoms in patients treated with low-dose SSRIs?,Activation of the locus coeruleus (LC) and enhanced noradrenaline efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex.,"The abstract links low-dose fluoxetine to increased LC activity and noradrenaline release, which are associated with heightened anxiety responses, including escape behaviors in stress models."

Comorbid depression can exacerbate the effects of medical illness and may be an independent source of suffering and disability. Data from the Epidemiological Follow-Up Study (NHEFS) of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) are used to examine the manner in which depression and comorbid medical conditions interact to affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The findings suggest a) that the effects of depression are comparable with those of arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension; and b) that depression and chronic medical illnesses interact to amplify the effects of the medical illness.

11958784,Salivary cortisol concentrations before and after carbon-dioxide inhalations in children.,"Considerable research implicates over-activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis in the pathophysiology of adult mood and anxiety disorders. The current study evaluates the association between salivary cortisol concentrations and response to carbon-dioxide inhalation in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders, mood disorders, or no psychiatric illness. The central question was whether response to carbon-dioxide inhalation is associated with levels of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis activation. If confirmed, this would relate hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis activation in juveniles, as in adults, and response to a well-studied respiratory procedure. Serial salivary cortisol samples were examined in 98 subjects (ages 9-17 years), including 62 subjects with an anxiety and/or mood disorder and 36 nonpsychiatrically ill comparisons. Samples were obtained upon arrival at the laboratory, following a tilt test, then before and immediately after a standard 5% carbon dioxide inhalation procedure. Salivary cortisol levels pre-carbon-dioxide inhalation were significantly higher in patients sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of carbon dioxide (n = 20) than in patients who did not respond to carbon dioxide (n = 42) and in healthy subjects, none of whom were sensitive to carbon dioxide (n = 36); cortisol concentrations in the latter two groups were indistinguishable. Salivary cortisol did not increase during carbon-dioxide inhalation, irrespective of diagnostic group or degree of reactivity to the procedure. The current data resemble data from studies of laboratory-induced panic among adult patients. In both groups, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis is associated with the response to a standardized stressor. Similarly, as in adults, carbon-dioxide inhalation in juveniles does not produce a significant change in hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis activation.",2002-Feb-15,Biological psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2002,YES,sa,How might baseline salivary cortisol levels predict sensitivity to anxiogenic effects of carbon-dioxide inhalation in juveniles with anxiety or mood disorders?,Higher baseline salivary cortisol levels are associated with sensitivity to the anxiogenic effects of carbon-dioxide inhalation.,"The abstract indicates that patients sensitive to carbon-dioxide inhalation had significantly higher pre-inhalation salivary cortisol levels compared to non-reactive patients and healthy controls, suggesting a predictive relationship."

The present study investigated the effect of detoxification on these symptoms over 4-5 weeks of abstinence from alcohol. Psychopathology and global functioning were assessed at baseline and at weekly intervals over this period from 28 alcoholics treated on an inpatient basis. At intake, they displayed high levels of anxiety and depression; also, global functioning was seriously impaired.

Prevalence estimates of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) were calculated in two different ways. The first was based on the ""classic"" criteria in which only January and February are regarded as the winter months. The second was based on the ""arctic"" criteria in which November and December are included as winter months. Prevalence estimates of classic SAD were 5.2% for men and 8.9% for women. Prevalence estimates of arctic SAD were 6.5% for men and 13.1% for women. Subjects who met arctic criteria but not classic criteria for SAD self-reported significantly more current depression than those who met classic criteria.

12213689,Time-to-remission from geriatric depression: psychosocial and clinical factors.,"The authors examined psychosocial and clinical predictors of time-to-remission in a sample of initially clinically depressed elderly patients. Using a standardized algorithm, a prospective cohort study enrolled 239 patients undergoing treatment. Patients were followed for up to 4.5 years, until death or withdrawal from the study. Baseline predictor variables included psychosocial factors, such as four domains of social support; basic and instrumental activities of daily living; and clinical factors, including use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), past history of depression, comorbidities, and antidepressant treatment. Only 33% of the sample (n=79) met our classification for depression remission. A lack of instrumental and subjective social support, poor self-rated health, the use of antipsychotic medication, or use of an antidepressant in the last 7 days were predictors of longer time-to-remission. Use of ECT in the last year was related to shorter time-to-remission.

12191791,Evaluation of the elevated plus-maze and open-field tests for the assessment of anxiety-related behaviour in inbred mice.,"The elevated plus-maze test (PM) and open-field test (OF) are routinely used to study anxiety-related behaviour in mouse. However, the data obtained with these tests have often been contradictory, probably because of differences between laboratories in the selection and analysis of behavioural parameters. We have characterised the pattern of mouse anxiety by analysing a number of behavioural parameters with both PM and OF in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, two behaviourally distant mouse strains. Twenty-eight variables (15 analysed with PM and 13 with OF) were selected by correlation analysis from those initially recorded with both tests. The scores of the selected variables were first analysed by MANOVAs, and then by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA extracted five factors for PM and four factors for OF.

12166090,[Clonazepam in the treatment of protracted depression: a hundred-case report].,"Clonazepam, which presently is recommended for the treatment of seizure disorders, has been reported to be useful as an adjunctive treatment for depression. The purpose of this paper was to examine the suitable adjunctive dose and the characteristics of clonazepam for the treatment of protracted depression. A hundred protracted depressive patients treated with clonazepam were studies by the retrospective method. A daily dose of 3.0 mg clonazepam as augmentation expressed high effectiveness (78.4%) on protracted depression. Most of the improved patients showed a rapid onset of action within two weeks. Gender, age, phase number, family history of psychosis, and clinical symptoms did not change the effectiveness of clonazepam treatment. A daily dose of at least 3.0 mg clonazepam as augmentation of ongoing antidepressant treatment should be considered for protracted depressive patients with suboptimal improvement. Unipolar depression was significantly more effective than bipolar depression on clonazepam treatment. The clear-cut difference in response to unipolar and bipolar depression suggests that the underlying abnormality in unipolar depression is not the same as that in bipolar depression. A continuance of clonazepam after improvement disturbed the recurrence of depression, and it seems that clonazepam augmentation has a preventive effect.",2002-Jun,Nihon shinkei seishin yakurigaku zasshi = Japanese journal of psychopharmacology,English Abstract; Journal Article,2002,YES,sa,"What minimum daily dose of clonazepam has been shown to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for protracted unipolar depression, and how quickly is its onset of action observed?",A minimum daily dose of 3.0 mg; onset of action is typically within two weeks.,"The abstract specifies that a daily dose of at least 3.0 mg clonazepam is highly effective (78.4%) for protracted unipolar depression, with most patients showing rapid improvement within two weeks."
27474960,A meta-analysis of the efficacy of vortioxetine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and high levels of anxiety symptoms.,"Coexisting anxiety is common in major depressive disorder (MDD) and more difficult to treat than depression without anxiety. This analysis assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vortioxetine in MDD patients with high levels of anxiety (baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A] total score ≥20). Efficacy was assessed using an aggregated, study-level meta-analysis of 10 randomized, placebo-controlled, 6/8-week trials of vortioxetine 5-20mg/day in adults (18-75 years), with a study in elderly patients (≥65 years) analyzed separately. Outcome measures included mean differences from placebo in change from baseline to endpoint (Δ) in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), HAM-A total, and HAM-A subscales. Safety and tolerability were assessed by treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 1497 (48.6%) vortioxetine-treated and 860 (49.1%) placebo-treated patients had baseline HAM-A≥20. There were significant differences from placebo in MADRS (vortioxetine 5mg/day, n=415, Δ-2.68, P=0.005; 10mg/day, n=373, Δ-3.59, P<0.001; 20mg/day, n=207, Δ-4.30, P=0.005) and HAM-A total (5mg/day, n=419, Δ-1.64, P=0.022; 10mg/day, n=373, Δ-2.04, P=0.003; 20mg/day, n=207, Δ-2.19, P=0.027). There were significantly greater improvements versus placebo on the HAM-A psychic subscale for all doses. The most common TEAEs (≥5.0%) were nausea, headache, dizziness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, constipation, and vomiting. Incidence of serious TEAEs was 1.3% (placebo) and ≤1.3% (vortioxetine, across doses). Study heterogeneity limits this analysis. Patients with baseline HAM-A≥20 were not directly compared to baseline HAM-A<20 or total MDD population.

26913004,Plant Alkaloids as an Emerging Therapeutic Alternative for the Treatment of Depression.,"Depression is a heterogeneous mood disorder that has been classified and treated in a variety of ways. Although, a number of synthetic drugs are being used as standard treatment for clinically depressed patients, but they have adverse effects that can compromise the therapeutic treatments and patient's compliance. Unlike, synthetic medications, herbal medicines are widely used across the globe due to their wide applicability and therapeutic efficacy associated with least side effects, which in turn has initiated the scientific research regarding the antidepressant activity. This review is mostly based on the literature of the last decade, aimed at exploring the preclinical profile of plant-based alkaloids (the abundant secondary metabolite) as an emerging therapy for depression.",2016,Frontiers in pharmacology,,2016,YES,sa,Why might herbal medicines be preferred over synthetic drugs in the treatment of clinical depression?,"Herbal medicines have therapeutic efficacy with fewer side effects, improving patient compliance compared to synthetic drugs.","The abstract states that synthetic drugs can have adverse effects that compromise treatment and compliance, whereas herbal medicines offer wide applicability and efficacy with minimal side effects."
27376660,Risk and protective factors for antepartum and postpartum depression: a prospective study.,"Antepartum risk and protective factors for postpartum depression (PPD; the most common mental disorder after childbirth besides postpartum anxiety), have been frequently investigated in cross-sectional studies, but less often longitudinally. This study examined linear and moderator effects of risk and protective factors for peripartum depression. First, we investigated the predictive power of risk factors (physical problems during pregnancy, pregnancy-related anxiety, stressful life events, dysfunctional self-consciousness (DSC)) and protective factors (resilience, social support) for antepartum depression (APD) and PPD. Second, as DSC plays an important role in major depression, we examined whether the protective factors moderate the association between the risk factors DSC and APD as well as PPD. We conducted a prospective study with three measurement time points: six weeks antepartum (N = 297), as well as six weeks (N = 278) and twelve weeks (N = 266) postpartum. Direct and moderator effects on APD were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis. Moderated mediation effects were investigated to explore whether the indirect, long-term effect of DSC on PPD six weeks after birth (PPD-6) and PPD twelve weeks after birth (PPD-12) is moderated by resilience. Predictors for APD were high DSC, high concerns about one's appearance, low resilience and low social support. Resilience buffered (weakened) the impact of DSC on APD and affected PPD-6 and PPD-12 indirectly through APD. The results suggest that PPD-12 is influenced directly and indirectly through PPD-6 by APD, but that this effect depends upon risk and protective factors, especially on the combined effects of resilience and DSC. The key finding of our study is the moderating (i.e. weakening) effect of resilience on the relationship between DSC and depression. Resilience and DSC may be an important issue for depression prevention and treatment programs in the peripartum period.",2016-Dec,Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,,2016,YES,sa,How does resilience impact the relationship between dysfunctional self-consciousness (DSC) and postpartum depression (PPD) over time?,"Resilience weakens the effect of DSC on antepartum depression (APD), which indirectly reduces the impact of DSC on PPD at 6 and 12 weeks postpartum.","The abstract states that resilience moderates (weakens) the relationship between DSC and APD. Since APD influences PPD both directly and indirectly, resilience mitigates the long-term depressive effects of DSC in the peripartum period."
26913456,Behavioural changes induced by a conditional disruption of bone formation.,"It has been shown that the brain regulates bone remodelling through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres. However, it is unclear if signals from the skeleton also influence brain functions and animal behaviours. Bone formation was conditionally disrupted by daily injections of aciclovir (10 mg/kg) to transgenic mice expressing a herpes-simplex-virus thymidine kinase under the control of the osteoblast-specific promoter of the Bglap gene. Behavioural studies were conducted after 10 weeks of treatment. Transgenic mice receiving aciclovir injections showed a reduced number of osteoblasts with a concomitantly reduced trabecular bone volume density, when compared to wild-type controls that were treated identically. The general health of the animals was not severely affected, as indicated by a similar increase in body weight, similar activity profiles and similar social behaviours. However, transgenic mice showed significantly increased despair behaviour and increased adrenal gland weights. Specific animal behaviours can be modulated by a selective disruption of bone formation. The increased despair behaviour observed in transgenic animals indicates that these animals may be more prone to depression-related phenotypes. These findings are important in the context of the well-established clinical association between depression and reduced bone mass.",2016-May-01,Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,,2016,YES,sa,How might disrupted bone formation contribute to the pathophysiology of depression?,"Disrupted bone formation may increase despair behavior and adrenal gland weights, suggesting a link between skeletal signals and depression-related phenotypes.","The abstract shows that selective disruption of bone formation in transgenic mice led to increased despair behavior and adrenal gland weights, correlating reduced bone mass with depression-like traits."
26402345,"""Depression is who I am"": Mental illness identity, stigma and wellbeing.","Previous research has found that in the face of discrimination, people tend to identify more strongly with stigmatized groups. Social identification can, in turn, buffer wellbeing against the negative consequences of discrimination. However, this rejection identification model has never been tested in the context of mental illness identity. A survey was conducted with 250 people with diagnosed depression or current symptoms of at least moderate clinical severity. Experiencing mental illness stigma was associated with poorer wellbeing. Furthermore, people who had experienced such stigma were more likely to identify as a depressed person. Social identification as depressed magnified, rather than buffered, the relationship between stigma and reduced wellbeing. This relationship was moderated by perceived social norms of the depressed group for engaging in depressive thoughts and behaviors. These findings suggest that mental illness stigma is a double-edged sword: as well as the direct harms for wellbeing, by increasing identification with other mental illness sufferers, stigma might expose sufferers to harmful social influence processes.",2016-Jan-01,Journal of affective disorders,,2016,YES,sa,How might social identification with a stigmatized group exacerbate the impact of mental illness stigma on wellbeing in individuals with clinical depression?,It can magnify stigma's negative effects by reinforcing harmful social norms related to depressive thoughts and behaviors within the identified group.,"The abstract states that stigma increases identification as a depressed person, which amplifies its harmful effects due to exposure to maladaptive social norms within the depressed group."
27979754,Design of the integrative medical group visits randomized control trial for underserved patients with chronic pain and depression.,"Given the public health crisis of opioid overprescribing for pain, there is a need for evidence-based non pharmacological treatment options that effectively reduce pain and depression. We aim to examine the effectiveness of the Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) model in reducing chronic pain and depressive symptoms, as well as increasing pain self-management. This paper details the study design and implementation of an ongoing randomized controlled trial of the IMGV model as compared to primary care visits. The research aims to determine if the IMGV model is effective in achieving: a) a reduction in self-reported pain and depressive symptoms and 2) an improvement in the self-management of pain, through increasing pain self-efficacy and reducing use of self-reported pain medication. We intend to recruit 154 participants to be randomized in our intervention, the IMGV model (n=77) and to usual care (n=77). Usual care of chronic pain through pharmacological treatment has mixed evidence of efficacy and may not improve quality of life or functional status.

27136662,Cortical thickness and VBM in young women at risk for familial depression and their depressed mothers with positive family history.,"It has been demonstrated that compared to low-risk subjects, high-risk subjects for depression have structural and functional alterations in their brain scans even before the disease onset. However, it is not known if these alterations are related to vulnerability to depression or epiphenomena. One way to resolve this ambiguity is to detect the structural alterations in the high-risk subjects and determine if the same alterations are present in the probands. In this study, we recruited 24 women with the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with recurrent episodes and their healthy daughters (the high-risk for familial depression group; HRFD). We compared structural brain scans of the patients and HRFG group with those of 24 age-matched healthy mothers and their healthy daughters at similar ages to the HRFD group; respectively. Both cortical gray matter (GM) volume and thickness analyses revealed that HRFD daughters and their MDD mothers had similar GM differences in two regions: the right temporoparietal region and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results suggested that the observed alterations may be related to trait clinical and neurophysiological characteristics of MDD and may present before the onset of illness.",2016-Jun-30,Psychiatry research.

27867364,An Objective Screening Method for Major Depressive Disorder Using Logistic Regression Analysis of Heart Rate Variability Data Obtained in a Mental Task Paradigm.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) has been intensively studied as a promising biological marker of major depressive disorder (MDD). Our previous study confirmed that autonomic activity and reactivity in depression revealed by HRV during rest and mental task (MT) conditions can be used as diagnostic measures and in clinical evaluation. In this study, logistic regression analysis (LRA) was utilized for the classification and prediction of MDD based on HRV data obtained in an MT paradigm. Power spectral analysis of HRV on R-R intervals before, during, and after an MT (random number generation) was performed in 44 drug-naïve patients with MDD and 47 healthy control subjects at Department of Psychiatry in Shizuoka Saiseikai General Hospital. Logit scores of LRA determined by HRV indices and heart rates discriminated patients with MDD from healthy subjects. The high frequency (HF) component of HRV and the ratio of the low frequency (LF) component to the HF component (LF/HF) correspond to parasympathetic and sympathovagal balance, respectively. The LRA achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 80.0 and 79.0%, respectively, at an optimum cutoff logit score (0.28). Misclassifications occurred only when the logit score was close to the cutoff score. Logit scores also correlated significantly with subjective self-rating depression scale scores (<i>p</i> < 0.05). HRV indices recorded during a MT may be an objective tool for screening patients with MDD in psychiatric practice. The proposed method appears promising for not only objective and rapid MDD screening but also evaluation of its severity.",2016,Frontiers in psychiatry,,2016,YES,sa,What heart rate variability (HRV) indices are most relevant for assessing autonomic dysfunction and sympathovagal imbalance in major depressive disorder during a mental task?,High frequency (HF) component and low frequency to high frequency ratio (LF/HF).,"The HF component reflects parasympathetic activity, while the LF/HF ratio indicates sympathovagal balance, both of which were key HRV measures used to classify and predict major depressive disorder in the study."
27919514,The psychological impact of symptoms related to esophagogastric cancer resection presenting in primary care: A national linked database study.,"The objective was to evaluate incidence, risk factors and impact of postoperative symptoms following esophagogastric cancer resection in primary care. Patients undergoing esophagogastrectomy for cancer from 1998 to 2010 with linked records in Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episodes Statistics and Office of National Statistics databases were studied. The recording of codes for reflux, dysphagia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, dumping, diarrhea, steatorrhea, appetite loss, weight loss, pain and fatigue were identified up to 12 months postoperatively. Psychiatric morbidity was also examined and its risk evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Overall, 58.6% (1029/1755) of patients were alive 2 years after surgery. Of these, 41.1% had recorded postoperative symptoms. Reflux, dysphagia, dyspepsia and pain were more frequent following esophagectomy compared with gastrectomy (p < 0.05). Complications (OR = 1.40 95%CI 1.00-1.95) and surgical procedure predicted postoperative symptoms (p < 0.05).

27274384,Pharmacotherapy of Acute Bipolar Depression in Adults: An Evidence Based Approach.,"In the majority of cases of bipolar disorder, manic episodes are usually brief and typically responsive to currently available psychopharmacological agents. In contrast, depressive manifestations are more prevalent and persistent, and can present as major depressive/mixed episodes or residual interepisode symptoms. The depressive phase is often associated with other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as anxiety spectrum disorders, substance use disorders, stressor-related disorders, and eating disorders. It is viewed as a systemic disease with associated ailments such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. There is an increased rate of mortality not only from suicide, but also from concomitant physical illness. This scenario is made worse by the fact that depressive symptoms, which represent the main disease burden, are often refractory to existing psychotropic drugs. As such, there is a pressing need for novel agents that are efficacious in acute depressive exacerbations, and also have applicable value in preventing recurrent episodes. The rationale of the present review is to delineate the pharmacotherapy of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder with medications for which there is evidence in the form of observational, open-label, or double-blind randomized controlled studies. In the treatment of acute bipolar depression in adults, a comprehensive appraisal of the extant literature reveals that among mood stabilizers, the most robust proof of efficacy exists for divalproex sodium; while atypical antipsychotics, which include olanzapine, quetiapine, lurasidone, and cariprazine, are also effective, as demonstrated in controlled trials.",2016-May,Korean journal of family medicine,,2016,YES,sa,Which mood stabilizer has the most robust evidence of efficacy for the treatment of acute bipolar depression in adults?,Divalproex sodium,"The abstract states that, among mood stabilizers, divalproex sodium has the most robust evidence of efficacy for treating acute bipolar depression in adults, as supported by observational, open-label, or double-blind randomized controlled studies."
27158587,Neural responses to maternal praise and criticism: Relationship to depression and anxiety symptoms in high-risk adolescent girls.,"The parent-child relationship may be an important factor in the development of adolescent depressive and anxious symptoms. In adults, depressive symptoms relate to increased amygdala and attenuated prefrontal activation to maternal criticism. The current pilot study examined how depressive and anxiety symptoms in a high-risk adolescent population relate to neural responses to maternal feedback. Given previous research relating oxytocin to maternal behavior, we conducted exploratory analyses using oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genotype. Eighteen females (ages 12-16) listened to maternal praise, neutral, and critical statements during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants completed the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire and the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders. The OXTR single nucleotide polymorphism, rs53576, was genotyped. Linear mixed models were used to identify symptom or allele (GG, AA/AG) by condition (critical, neutral, praise) interaction effects on brain activation. Greater symptoms related to greater right amygdala activation for criticism and reduced activation to praise. For left amygdala, greater symptoms related to reduced activation to both conditions. Anxiety symptoms related to differences in superior medial PFC activation patterns. Parental OXTR AA/AG allele related to reduced activation to criticism and greater activation to praise within the right amygdala. Results support a relationship between anxiety and depressive symptoms and prefrontal-amygdala responses to maternal feedback. The lateralization of amygdala findings suggests separate neural targets for interventions reducing reactivity to negative feedback or increasing salience of positive feedback. Exploratory analyses suggest that parents' OXTR genetic profile influences parent-child interactions and related adolescent brain responses.",2016,NeuroImage.

Focus groups and individual interviews involving people waiting for or who had undergone publicly funded bariatric surgery were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. A total of 11 women and 6 men engaged in one of six focus groups in 2014, and an additional 10 women and 9 men were interviewed in 2015. Mean age was 53 years (range 23-66); mean waiting time was 6 years (range 0-12), and mean time since surgery was 4 years (range 0-11). Waiting was commonly reported as emotionally challenging (e.g. frustrating, depressing, stressful) and often associated with weight gain (despite weight-loss attempts) and deteriorating physical health (e.g. development of new or worsening obesity-related comorbidity or decline in mobility) or psychological health (e.g. development of or worsening depression). Peer support, health and mental health counselling, integrated care and better communication about waitlist position and management (e.g. patient prioritization) were identified support needs.

26787298,Nonsynonymous HTR2C polymorphism predicts cortisol response to psychosocial stress I: Effects in males and females.,"Genetic influences on stress reactivity may provide insight into depression risk mechanisms. The C-allele of rs6318, a putatively functional polymorphism located within the HTR2C gene, has been reported to predict greater cortisol and negative affective reactivity to lab-induced stress. However, the potential moderating effect of sex has not been examined despite X-linkage of HTR2C. We hypothesized that sex moderates the effect of rs6318 on cortisol and affective reactivity to lab-induced stress, with males showing stronger effects. Non-depressed young adults (N=112; 39 female) screened via clinical interview provided a DNA sample and completed either a negative evaluative Trier Social Stress Test, or a non-evaluative control protocol. Salivary cortisol and self-reported affect were assessed at four timepoints. Contrary to hypotheses, C-carriers showed blunted rather than exaggerated cortisol responses to lab-induced stress in multilevel models (b=0.467, p<0.001), which persisted when covarying subclinical depressive symptoms. This effect was not moderated by sex (b=0.174, p=0.421), and remained significant when examining females (b=0.362, p=0.013) and males (b=0.537, p<0.001) separately. C-carriers also exhibited marginally greater reactivity in negative self-focused affect in response to stress than non-carriers when covarying subclinical depressive symptoms (b=-0.360, p=0.067), and exhibited higher levels of subclinical depressive symptoms than non-carriers (F=6.463, p=0.012).

27969003,Parents in prevention: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of parenting interventions to prevent internalizing problems in children from birth to age 18.,"Burgeoning evidence that modifiable parental factors can influence children's and adolescents' risk for depression and anxiety indicates that parents can play a crucial role in prevention of these disorders in their children. However, it remains unclear whether preventive interventions that are directed primarily at the parent (i.e. where the parent receives more than half of the intervention) are effective in reducing child internalizing (including both depression and anxiety) problems in the longer term. Compared to a range of comparison conditions, parenting interventions reduced child internalizing problems, at a minimum of 6months after the intervention was delivered. Mean effects were very small for measures of internalizing and depressive symptoms, and small for measures of anxiety symptoms. Pooled effects for anxiety diagnoses were significant and indicated a number needed to treat (NNT) of 10. Pooled effects for depression diagnoses approached significance but suggested a NNT of 11.

26535964,Stress-induced anhedonia is associated with the activation of the inflammatory system in the rat brain: Restorative effect of pharmacological intervention.,"Major depression is a complex disease that originates from the interaction between a genetic background of susceptibility and environmental factors such as stress. At molecular level, it is characterized by dysfunctions of multiple systems including neurotransmitters, hormones, signalling pathways, neurotrophic and neuroplastic molecules and - more recently - inflammatory mediators. Accordingly, in the present study we used the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm in the rat to elucidate to what extent brain inflammation may contribute to the development and/or the maintenance of an anhedonic phenotype and how pharmacological intervention may interfere with such behavioral and molecular stress-induced alterations. To this aim, adult male rats were exposed to CMS for 2 weeks and the cerebral expression of several mediators of the inflammatory system was evaluated in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of both stressed and control animals in parallel with the sucrose intake. Next, the animals that showed a decreased sucrose consumption were exposed to five further weeks of CMS and treated with the antidepressants imipramine or agomelatine, or the antipsychotic lurasidone. Our results demonstrate that only the stressed animals that were characterized by a deficit in sucrose intake showed increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and up-regulation of markers and mediators of microglia activation such as CD11b, CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 in comparison with stress-resilient animals. Some of these molecular alterations persisted also after longer stress exposure and were modulated, similarly to the behavioral effects of CMS, by chronic pharmacological treatment. These data suggest that neuroinflammation may have a key role in the pathological consequences of stress exposure, thus contributing to the subject's vulnerability for depression.",2016-Jan,Pharmacological research,,2016,YES,sa,"Which inflammatory markers are associated with anhedonia in stress-induced depression, and how can they be modulated pharmacologically?","IL-1β, IL-6, CD11b, CX3CL1, and CX3CR1; modulated by imipramine, agomelatine, or lurasidone.","The abstract links anhedonia in stress-induced depression to increased expression of IL-1β, IL-6, CD11b, CX3CL1, and CX3CR1, which are modulated by chronic treatment with antidepressants or antipsychotics."
26688496,Polysomnographic characteristics of bipolar hypomanic patients: Comparison with unipolar depressed patients.,"Sleep profile in bipolar disorder has received little attention in comparison to sleep studies in major depressive disorders. Specific sleep abnormalities especially in REM sleep parameters have been detected in depression. The current study aimed at investigating whether bipolar disorder shares the same polysomnographic (PSG) changes or not. All night polysomnographic assessments were made for 20 patients diagnosed to have hypomania, in addition to 20 patients with major depression and 20 healthy matched controls. All participants were examined using Standardized Sleep Questionnaire, SCID-I for psychiatric diagnosis, based on DSM-IV criteria, YMRS (for hypomanic patients), HAMD (for major depression patients), and all-night polysomnography (for all subjects). The two patient groups differed significantly from controls in their sleep profile, especially regarding sleep continuity measures, Short REML (Rapid Eye Movement Latency), with increased REMD (Rapid Eye Movement sleep density). High similarity was found in EEG sleep profile of the two patient groups, though the changes were more robust in patients with depression A relatively small sample size, the absence of follow up assessment, lack of consideration of other variables like body mass index, nicotine and caffeine intake. Similarity in EEG sleep profile between Bipolar disorder patients and patients with major depression suggests a common biological origin for both conditions, with the difference being ""quantitative"" rather than ""qualitative"".

27235637,Leptin serum concentrations are associated with weight gain during lithium augmentation.,"Meta-analytical data show lithium augmentation (LA) as an effective treatment strategy in major depression. Weight-gain is a common side effect of LA. The proteohormone leptin is discussed to be involved in the pathophysiology of weight gain induced by psychopharmacological treatment. The purpose of our study was to investigate the association of leptin and body mass index (BMI) during LA in a prospective cohort study. Leptin serum concentrations and body mass index (BMI) were measured in a total of 89 acute depressive patients before and then after four weeks of LA. In a linear mixed model analysis the following variables had a significant positive effect on BMI: time (equal with ""treatment effect of LA""; F1.83=6.05; p=0.016) and leptin (F1.111=13.83; p=0.0003) as well as the covariates male gender (F1.89=5.08; p=0.027) and adiposity (F1.85=105.13; p<0.0001).

28718716,"Estimating the number of adults with severe and persistent mental illness who have complex, multi-agency needs.","A population health approach to mental health service planning requires estimates that align interventions with the needs of people with mental illness. The primary objective was to estimate the number of people in Australia living with severe and persistent mental illness who have complex, multi-agency needs. The secondary objective was to describe the possible service needs of individuals with severe mental illness. We disaggregated the estimated 12-month prevalence of adults with severe mental illness into needs-based sub-groups, using multiple data sources. Possible service needs of 1825 adults with psychotic disorders and 334 adults with severe past-year affective and/or anxiety disorders were described using data from the 2010 Survey of High Impact Psychosis and 2007 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, respectively. Using best available data, we estimated that 3.3% of adults experience a severe mental illness each year, of whom one-third (1.1% of adults) experience a persistent mental illness that requires ongoing services to address residual disability. Among those with severe and persistent mental illness, one-third of adults (0.4% or 59,000 adults in 2015) have complex needs requiring multi-agency support to maximise their health, housing, social participation and personal functioning. Survey of High Impact Psychosis data indicated that among adults with psychotic disorders, use of accommodation (40%), non-government (30%) services and receipt of income support (85%) services were common, as were possible needs for support with socialising, personal care and employment. National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing data indicated that among individuals with severe affective and anxiety disorders, receipt of income support (37%) was common (information on accommodation and non-government support services was not available), as were possible needs for financial management and employment support.

In this prospective study 63 oocyte-donating women and, as a control group, 63 women providing their own oocytes for in vitro fertilization (in couples with male infertility) were evaluated pre- and post-ovulation-induction in regard to hypochondriasis, anxiety, social impairment, and depression. The mean hypochondriasis score for oocyte-donators was significantly lower than for women providing their own oocytes, prior to ovulation-induction (5.03 vs. 6.59). However, after ovulation-induction and oocyte retrieval this score rose to 6.66 among oocyte-donators, whereas it remained essentially unchanged among women providing their own oocytes (6.66). The mean anxiety score for oocyte-donating women also rose following this procedure, from 5.87 to 7.65. Depression scores for both groups remained similar, before and after the procedure.

The goal of the current investigation was to examine the relationship between negative mood and compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) and to assess for their individual and combined influence on sexual risk-taking behavior among a diverse sample of YMSM in New York City (the P18 Cohort Study). We first analyzed sociodemographic, depressive symptoms, CSB, and sexual risk-taking from the cross-sectional data of 509, 18- or 19-year-old YMSM recruited using non-probability sampling. We found a significant positive correlation between CSB and depression and between CSB and frequency of condomless anal sex acts reported over the last 30 days. Multivariate results found that the presence of both depression and CSB contributed to elevated sexual risk-taking among these urban YMSM. Clinical implications include the importance of assessing for CSB when depression is present and vice versa in order to improve HIV prevention. Informed by minority stress theory and syndemic theory, our results suggest that interventions focused on the health of YMSM recognize that mental health and social context all interact to increase physical health vulnerability vis-a-vis sexual behaviors, depression, and CSB.

27628244,Anxiety disorders and all-cause mortality: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between anxiety disorders, or clinically significant anxiety symptoms, at baseline and all-cause mortality at follow-up relative to control participants without clinically significant anxiety. PubMed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL were searched through July 2015, along with manual searches of published reviews and forward and backward snowball searches of included studies. Studies were excluded if anxiety was not defined with a standardized instrument, or if participants were followed-up for 1 year or less. The initial search yielded 7901 articles after the removal of duplicates, of which 328 underwent full-text screening. Forty-two estimates from 36 articles were included in the meta-analysis with a total sample of 127,552 participants and over 11,573 deaths. The overall hazard ratio (HR) estimate of mortality in clinically anxious participants relative to controls was 1.09 (95 % CI 1.01-1.16); however, this was reduced after adjusting for publication bias (1.03; 95 % CI 0.95-1.13).

27765060,Side effect profile similarities shared between antidepressants and immune-modulators reveal potential novel targets for treating major depressive disorders.,"Side effects, or the adverse effects of drugs, contain important clinical phenotypic information that may be useful in predicting novel or unknown targets of a drug. It has been suggested that drugs with similar side-effect profiles may share common targets. The diagnostic class, Major Depressive Disorder, is increasingly viewed as being comprised of multiple depression subtypes with different biological root causes. One 'type' of depression generating substantial interest today focuses on patients with high levels of inflammatory burden, indicated by elevated levels of C-reactive proteins (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6). It has been suggested that drugs targeting the immune system may have beneficial effect on this subtype of depressed patients, and several studies are underway to test this hypothesis directly. However, patients have been treated with both anti-inflammatory and antidepressant compounds for decades. It may be possible to exploit similarities in clinical readouts to better understand the antidepressant effects of immune-related drugs. Here we explore the space of approved drugs by comparing the drug side effect profiles of known antidepressants and drugs targeting the immune system, and further examine the findings by comparing the human cell line expression profiles induced by them with those induced by antidepressants. We found 7 immune-modulators and 14 anti-inflammatory drugs sharing significant side effect profile similarities with antidepressants. Five of the 7 immune modulators share most similar side effect profiles with antidepressants that modulate dopamine release and/or uptake. In addition, the immunosuppressant rapamycin and the glucocorticoid alclometasone induces transcriptional changes similar to multiple antidepressants. These findings suggest that some antidepressants and some immune-related drugs may affect common molecular pathways. Our findings support the idea that certain medications aimed at the immune system may be helpful in relieving depressive symptoms, and suggest that it may be of value to test immune-modulators for antidepressant-like activity in future proof-of-concept studies.",2016-Oct-21,BMC pharmacology & toxicology,,2016,YES,sa,"Which biological marker indicates a subtype of depression that may respond to immune-modulating drugs, and why might these drugs be effective?",Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).

A single blind, individually randomized, pragmatic trial of a depression self-care toolkit (Toolkit) with or without lay telephone coaching was conducted among primary care adults with depressive symptoms and comorbid chronic physical conditions. Eligible patients were randomized to receive the Toolkit with (intervention) or without (control) telephone coaching provided by trained lay coaches. The primary outcome was depression severity [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)] at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were self-efficacy, satisfaction, and use of health services at 6 months. A total of 223 patients were randomized, and 172 (77.1%) completed 6-month follow-ups. PHQ-9 scores improved significantly in both groups over the 6-month follow-up; the differences in PHQ-9 scores between intervention and control groups were statistically significant at 3 months [effect size = 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.70] but not at 6 months (effect size = 0.23; 95% CI = -0.04-0.59).

26546833,Dysfunction in amygdala-prefrontal plasticity and extinction-resistant avoidance: A model for anxiety disorder vulnerability.,"Individuals exhibiting an anxiety disorder are believed to possess an innate vulnerability that makes them susceptible to the disorder. Anxiety disorders are also associated with abnormalities in the interconnected brain regions of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the link between anxiety vulnerability and amygdala-PFC dysfunction is currently unclear. Accordingly, the present study sought to determine if innate dysfunction within the amygdala to PFC projection underlies the susceptibility to develop anxiety-like behavior, using an anxiety vulnerable rodent model. The inbred Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat was used to model vulnerability, as this strain naturally expresses extinction-resistant avoidance; a behavior that models the symptom of avoidance present in anxiety disorders. Synaptic plasticity was assessed within the projection from the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) to the prelimbic cortical subdivision of the PFC in WKY and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. While WKY rats exhibited normal paired-pulse plasticity, they did not maintain long-term potentiation (LTP) as SD rats. Thus, impaired plasticity within the BLA-PL cortex projection may contribute to extinction resistant avoidance of WKY, as lesions of the PL cortex in SD rats impaired extinction of avoidance similar to WKY rats. Treatment with d-cycloserine to reverse the impaired LTP in WKY rats was unsuccessful. The lack of LTP in WKY rats was associated with a significant reduction of NMDA receptors containing NR2A subunits in the PL cortex. Thus, dysfunction in amygdala-PFC plasticity is innate in anxiety vulnerable rats and may promote extinction-resistant avoidance by disrupting communication between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.",2016-Jan,Experimental neurology,,2016,YES,sa,What neurobiological dysfunction may underlie extinction-resistant avoidance behavior in anxiety disorders?,"Impaired synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala to prelimbic cortex projection, linked to reduced NMDA receptors containing NR2A subunits in the prelimbic cortex.",The abstract identifies impaired plasticity in the BLA-PL projection and reduced NR2A-containing NMDA receptors in the PL cortex as innate dysfunctions promoting extinction-resistant avoidance in anxiety-vulnerable rats.

We examined the characteristics of subgroups of palliative cancer patients who expressed a desire for death that occurred either with or without a concurrent depressive or anxiety disorder. Cross-sectional survey. Eight Canadian palliative care programs. 377 patients with cancer. Desire for Death Rating Scale; Structured Interview of Symptoms and Concerns. Most participants (69.5%) had no desire for death. Of the remainder, 69 (18.3%) acknowledged occasional transient thoughts, and 46 (12.2%) reported an apparently genuine desire to die. In the latter group, 24 individuals (52.2%) were diagnosed with a mental disorder and 22 (44.8%) were not. Individuals with no serious desire for death and no mental disorder reported the least distress in physical, social, existential, and psychological symptoms and concerns; those with a mental disorder and a significant desire for death reported the most. The subgroup of patients with a serious desire for death but no concurrent mental disorders still reported increased distress due to physical symptoms and social concerns, as well as a higher prevalence of global suffering.

This study investigated the efficacy of volunteer support in preventing repetition of self-harm. This study used a quasi-experimental design by assigning self-harm patients admitted to the emergency departments to an intervention group with volunteer support and treatment as usual (TAU) for 9 months and to a control group of TAU. Outcome measures include repetition of self-harm, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and level of depressive and anxiety symptoms. A total of 74 cases were recruited (38 participants; 36 controls). There were no significant differences in age, gender, and clinical condition between the two groups at the baseline. The intervention group showed significant improvements in hopelessness and depressive symptoms. However, the number of cases of suicide ideation and of repetition of self-harm episodes was similar for both groups at the postintervention period. Postdischarge care provided by volunteers showed significant improvement in hopelessness and depression. Volunteers have been commonly involved in suicide prevention services. Further research using rigorous methods is recommended for improving service quality in the long term.",2016-Nov,Crisis,,2016,YES,sa,"What psychosocial outcome improved significantly with volunteer-supported postdischarge care in patients with self-harm, despite no reduction in self-harm repetition or suicidal ideation?",Hopelessness and depressive symptoms improved significantly.,"The abstract states that volunteer-supported care led to significant improvements in hopelessness and depressive symptoms, even though there was no difference in self-harm repetition or suicidal ideation compared to treatment as usual."
26891040,Brain levels of high-energy phosphate metabolites and executive function in geriatric depression.,"Depression in late life has been associated with difficulties in cognitive processing, particularly in the domains of executive function, processing speed and memory, and increases the risk of developing dementia suggesting a neurodegenerative phenotype. Mitochondrial dysfunction is frequently an early event in neurodegenerative illnesses and may be operative in patients with late life depression. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) allows for the quantification of bioenergetic molecules produced by mitochondria. Ten patients with late life depression and eight normal elderly controls were studied with Stroop color and interference tests, which are widely used measures of processing speed and executive function, respectively, followed by (31P) MRS 3-dimensional chemical-shift imaging measuring levels of adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate, and pH over the whole brain. In all subjects, gray matter phosphocreatine was positively associated with Stroop interference. Levels of white matter adenosine triphosphate were associated with Stroop interference in subjects with late life depression but not normal elderly. There was also a complementary association between white matter inorganic phosphate and Stroop interference in late life depression patients. These findings suggest two independent sources of executive function dependence on bioenergetic state in the aging brain. The dependence of executive function performance in subjects with late life depression on ATP in white matter may be associated with mitochondrial impairment and is consistent with predictions of the vascular depression hypothesis. Further research with wider neuropsychological testing targeting bioenergetic markers could help clarify the scope of these effects.

28489321,Nicotine deprivation attenuates panic reactivity in smokers: Findings from a placebo-controlled nicotine patch study.,"Prospective studies consistently find that smoking is a risk factor for the development of panic disorder (PD). A possible explanation is that nicotine deprivation promotes heightened sensitivity to bodily sensations and/or arterial carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub> ). Abrams et al. (2011) previously found that, in response to a CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing challenge, smokers experiencing more (vs. less) intense nicotine withdrawal had more severe panic symptoms and a stronger urge to escape. However, participants were aware of the last time they smoked, leaving unclear the extent to which fear reactivity was influenced by the pharmacologic effects of nicotine deprivation versus beliefs regarding when nicotine was most recently used. The present study aimed to ascertain whether nicotine deprivation, independent of beliefs regarding recent nicotine use, promotes fear reactivity among smokers. Moderate to heavy smokers without PD (N = 25) participated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind study consisting of two sessions spaced 1 week apart. Participants abstained from nicotine for 2 hr prior to sessions. During one session participants were given a 21 mg nicotine replacement patch and, during the other, a placebo patch, with the order counterbalanced. For both sessions, after a 3-hr absorption period, participants underwent a 10-min CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing challenge. Wearing a nicotine (vs. placebo) patch increased self-reported panic reactivity among participants, but did not significantly affect physiological and behavioral measures of reactivity. In smokers without a history of PD, nicotine deprivation attenuates subjective panic reactivity. Possible explanations for the contrast between theory and laboratory findings as well as clinical implications are discussed.",2017-Nov,Depression and anxiety,,2017,YES,sa,What effect does nicotine deprivation have on subjective panic reactivity in smokers without panic disorder during a CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing challenge?,Nicotine deprivation attenuates subjective panic reactivity.,"The abstract indicates that wearing a nicotine patch increased self-reported panic reactivity, suggesting that nicotine deprivation reduces subjective panic reactivity in smokers without a history of panic disorder."
28989210,The relationship between automatic thoughts and depression in a cognitive-behavioral treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS: Exploring temporality and causality.,"Depression in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is highly prevalent and related to worse adherence to antiretroviral therapy, but is amenable to change via CBT. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for adherence and depression (CBT-AD) specifically addresses negative automatic thoughts (ATs) as one component of the treatment. There is little research on the temporal nature of the relation between ATs and depression. HIV-positive adults with depression (N=240) were randomized to CBT-AD, information/supportive psychotherapy for adherence and depression (ISP-AD), or one session of adherence counseling alone (ETAU). ATs were self-reported (Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire; ATQ) and depression was assessed by blinded interview (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MADRS) at baseline, and 4-, 8-, and 12-months. We performed autoregressive cross-lagged panel models. Broadly, decreases in ATs were followed by decreases in depression, but decreases in depression were not followed by decreases in ATs. In CBT-AD, decreases in ATs were followed by decreases in depression, and vice versa. However, in the ISP group, while depression and ATs both significantly influenced each other, not all relations were in the direction expected. This study adds to the evidence base for cognitive interventions to decrease depression in individuals with a chronic medical condition, HIV/AIDS.",2017-Oct,Cognitive therapy and research,,2017,YES,sa,"In patients with HIV/AIDS and depression, how do changes in negative automatic thoughts influence depression outcomes during cognitive-behavioral therapy?","Decreases in negative automatic thoughts are followed by decreases in depression, and vice versa, during CBT for adherence and depression.","The abstract states that CBT-AD shows reciprocal influences between decreases in automatic thoughts and depression, highlighting the efficacy of cognitive interventions in this population."
28667564,The influence of unmet supportive care needs on anxiety and depression during cancer treatment and beyond: a longitudinal study of survivors of haematological cancers.,"This paper aims to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between patient-reported unmet needs and anxiety and depression for survivors of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multiple myeloma (MM). In a longitudinal study design, self-reported data were collected through telephone interviews at two time points approximately 7 (T1) and 15 (T2) months post-diagnosis. The sample was recruited through the population-based Victorian Cancer Registry. At T1 and T2, the study outcomes, anxiety and depression, were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and unmet needs were measured using the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34). Questions related to social/family problems, relationship problems and financial problems were also asked. A three-step multivariable hierarchical logistic regression analysis examined the relative role of T1 anxiety and depression, T1 and T2 unmet needs and other psychosocial factors with T2 anxiety and depression. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were observed between unmet needs and psychological distress. T2 anxiety was associated with T1 anxiety (OR 4.75, 95% CI 1.86-11.09), T2 psychological needs (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) and with T1 social problems (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.03-5.05) in multivariate analysis. T2 depression was associated with both T1 (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.57) and T2 psychological needs (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06-1.70), T2 physical needs (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.27-2.81) and T1 depression (OR 4.52, 95% CI 1.88-10.86). Unmet needs that manifest following diagnosis and treatment may persist into early survivorship and contribute to psychological distress. Addressing these needs during treatment may diminish the risk of current and future anxiety and depression.",2017-Nov,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,,2017,YES,sa,"In survivors of diffuse large B cell lymphoma or multiple myeloma, how do unmet psychological needs at early survivorship impact the risk of developing clinical depression later?","Unmet psychological needs increase the risk of later depression, with odds ratios of 1.35 at T2 and 1.28 at T1.","The abstract shows that unmet psychological needs at both T1 and T2 are longitudinally associated with depression, emphasizing their role in persistent psychological distress during survivorship."
28277687,Subjective social status and rumination in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychopathology among economically disadvantaged Latinos in primary care.,"The present investigation examined the interactive effects of subjective social status and rumination in relation to anxiety/depressive symptoms and psychopathology among 276 Latinos (82% female; M<sub>age</sub> = 39.2, SD = 11.1; 97.0% reported Spanish as first language) who attended a community-based primary health care clinic. Results indicated that the interaction between rumination and subjective social status was significantly associated with depression (B = -.04, t = -3.52, p < .001, 95% CI [-.06, -.02]), social anxiety (B = -.01, t = -3.84, p < .001, 95% CI [-.02, -.01]), and the number of mood and anxiety disorders (B = -.004, t = -2.80, p = .005, 95% CI [-.006, -.001]), after controlling for main effects of rumination and subjective social status. The form of the interactions suggested that the associations of rumination and the outcome variables were stronger for those with lower compared to higher subjective social status. For anxious arousal symptoms, however, there was not a statistically significant interaction. These findings underscore the potential importance of examining the interplay between rumination and subjective social status in regard to better understanding, and intervening to reduce, various forms of anxiety/depressive symptoms and disorders among Latinos in primary care settings.

27873517,Reliability and Validity of the Korean Version of the Lifetime Stressor Checklist-Revised in Psychiatric Outpatients with Anxiety or Depressive Disorders.,"Traumatic events and adverse stressful experiences are major etiological factors in a wide variety of physical and mental disorders. Developing psychological instruments that can be easily administered and that have good psychometric properties have become an integral part for research and practice. This study investigated the reliability and validity of the Korean version of the Lifetime Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) in a consecutive sample of psychiatric outpatients. The LSC-R is a 30-item self-reporting questionnaire examining lifetime traumatic and non-traumatic stressors. A final sample of 258 outpatients with anxiety or depressive disorders was recruited at the psychiatric department of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Self-reported data included the Life Events Checklist (LEC), the Zung Self-Rating Depression and Anxiety Scales, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, in addition to the LSC-R. A convenience sample of 50 college students completed the LSC-R on two occasions separated by a three week-interval for test-retest reliability. Mean kappa for temporal stability was high (κ=0.651) and Cronbach alpha was moderate (α=0.724). Convergent validity was excellent with corresponding items on the LEC. Concurrent validity was good for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that 11 factors explained 64.3 % of the total variance. This study demonstrated good psychometric properties of the Korean version of the LSC-R, further supporting its use in clinical research and practice with a Korean speaking population.",2017-Jan,Yonsei medical journal,,2017,YES,sa,What psychometric properties of a stressor checklist would support its use in evaluating psychiatric outpatients with anxiety or depressive disorders?,"High test-retest reliability (κ=0.651), moderate internal consistency (α=0.724), excellent convergent validity, and good concurrent validity.","The abstract highlights these properties for the Korean LSC-R, which demonstrated reliability and validity in assessing stressors linked to anxiety and depressive disorders in psychiatric outpatients."
28840406,Religiousness and health in Europe.,"Recent research suggests that epidemiological forces in religion and health can have opposed effects. Using longitudinal data of people aged 50+ included in wave 1 (2004-2005) of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), and followed up through waves 2 (2006-2007), 4 (2011) and 5 (2013), we examined two forms of religious internalization and their association with health. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine all associations. Taking part in a religious organization was associated with lower odds of GALI (global activity limitation index) (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.75, 0.98) and depressive symptoms 0.80 (95% CI 0.69, 0.93), whereas being religiously educated lowered odds of poor self-rated health (SRH) 0.81 (95% CI 0.70, 0.93) and long-term health problems 0.84 (95% CI 0.74, 0.95). The more religious had lower odds of limitations with activities of daily living 0.76 (95% CI 0.58, 0.99) and depressive symptoms 0.77 (95% CI 0.64, 0.92) than other respondents, and compared to people who only prayed and did not have organizational involvement, they had lower odds of poor SRH 0.71 (95% CI 0.52, 0.97) and depressive symptoms 0.66 (95% CI 0.50, 0.87). Conversely, people who only prayed had higher odds of depressive symptoms than non-religious people 1.46 (95% CI 1.15, 1.86). Our findings suggest two types of religiousness: 1. Restful religiousness (praying, taking part in a religious organization and being religiously educated), which is associated with good health, and 2. Crisis religiousness (praying without other religious activities), which is associated with poor health.",2017-Oct,European journal of epidemiology,,2017,YES,sa,"How might different forms of religious engagement influence the odds of developing depressive symptoms, and what clinical implications could this have for treatment planning?","Organizational involvement lowers odds of depressive symptoms, while isolated prayer increases them.

29097612,Generalizability of Clinical Trial Results for Adolescent Major Depressive Disorder.,"Although there have been a number of clinical trials evaluating treatments for adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD), the generalizability of those trials to samples of depressed adolescents who present for routine clinical care is unknown. Examining the generalizability of clinical trials of pharmacological and psychotherapy interventions for adolescent depression can help administrators and frontline practitioners determine the relevance of these studies for their patients and may also guide eligibility criteria for future clinical trials in this clinical population. Data on nationally representative adolescents were derived from the National Comorbidity Survey: Adolescent Supplement. To assess the generalizability of adolescent clinical trials for MDD, we applied a standard set of eligibility criteria representative of clinical trials to all adolescents in the National Comorbidity Survey: Adolescent Supplement with a <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</i> diagnosis of MDD (<i>N</i> = 592). From the overall MDD sample, 61.9% would have been excluded from a typical pharmacological trial, whereas 42.2% would have been excluded from a psychotherapy trial. Among those who sought treatment (<i>n</i> = 412), the corresponding exclusion rates were 72.7% for a pharmacological trial and 52.2% for a psychotherapy trial. The criterion leading to the largest number of exclusions was ""significant risk of suicide"" in both pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. Pharmacological and, to a lesser extent, psychotherapy clinical trials likely exclude most adolescents with MDD. Careful consideration should be given to balancing eligibility criteria and internal validity with applicability in routine clinical care while ensuring patient safety.",2017-Dec,Pediatrics,,2017,YES,sa,What eligibility criterion in clinical trials for adolescent depression most significantly reduces generalizability to routine clinical care populations?,Significant risk of suicide.,"The abstract states that 'significant risk of suicide' is the criterion leading to the largest number of exclusions in both pharmacological and psychotherapy trials, affecting generalizability to routine care populations."

Our goal was to determine if self-care tools plus limited telephone support could reduce depressive symptoms in patients with age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. A single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Eighty participants were recruited. To be eligible, participants must have had either late stage age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, at least mild depressive symptoms, and visual acuity better than 20/200. Half were randomized to the intervention arm and half to delayed intervention/usual care. The intervention consisted of large print written and audio tools incorporating cognitive-behavioral principles plus three 10-minute telephone calls from a lay coach. Eight-week follow-up data were collected by telephone. The primary outcome was the 8-week change in depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, life space and self-efficacy. The baseline mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.37 (SD = 0.20), and the baseline mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score was 9.5 (SD = 3.9) indicating moderate depressive symptoms. After adjusting for baseline imbalances in visual acuity, the intervention reduced depressive symptoms by 2.1 points more than usual care (P = 0.040).

Emanating from one state network's interest in advancing its practice in this area, the current study surveyed 159 home visitors on their current practices, training, knowledge, and perceived self‐efficacy, and perceived system‐ and client‐level barriers regarding client substance use and depression. Home visitors reported managing maternal depression more extensively than substance use, though overall management of both risk areas was low.

Depressed adolescents may show alterations in the functioning of neural systems supporting processing of social status information. We examined whether depressed youth exhibited altered neural activation to social status words in temporal and prefrontal cortical regions thought to be involved in social cognitive processing, and whether this response was associated with development. Forty-nine adolescents (ages 10-18; 35 female), including 20 with major depressive disorder and 29 controls, were scanned while identifying the valence of words that connoted positive and negative social status. Results indicated that depressed youth showed reduced late activation to social status (vs neutral) words in the superior temporal cortex (STC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC); whereas healthy youth did not show any significant differences between word types. Depressed youth also showed reduced late activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and fusiform gyrus to negative (vs positive) social status words; whereas healthy youth showed the opposite pattern. Finally, age was positively associated with MPFC activation to social status words.

28623605,Cathepsin C Aggravates Neuroinflammation Involved in Disturbances of Behaviour and Neurochemistry in Acute and Chronic Stress-Induced Murine Model of Depression.,"Major depression has been interpreted as an inflammatory disease characterized by cell-mediated immune activation, which is generally triggered by various stresses. Microglia has been thought to be the cellular link between inflammation and depression-like behavioural alterations. The expression of cathepsin C (Cat C), a lysosomal proteinase, is predominantly induced in microglia in neuroinflammation. However, little is known about the role of Cat C in pathophysiology of depression. In the present study, Cat C transgenic mice and wild type mice were subjected to an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.5 mg/kg) and 6-week unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) exposure to establish acute and chronic stress-induced depression model. We examined and compared the behavioural and proinflammatory cytokine alterations in serum and depression-targeted brain areas of Cat C differentially expressed mice in stress, as well as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) levels in brain. The results showed that Cat C overexpression (Cat C OE) promoted peripheral and central inflammatory response with significantly increased TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6 in serum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and resultant upregulation of IDO and downregulation of 5HT expression in brain, and thereby aggravated depression-like behaviours accessed by open field test, forced swim test and tail suspension test. In contrast, Cat C knockdown (Cat C KD) partially prevented inflammation, which may help alleviate the symptoms of depression in mice.

28031714,"Temperament, personality, and treatment outcome in major depression: a 6-month preliminary prospective study.","Despite available treatments, major depression is a highly heterogeneous disorder, which leads to problems in classification and treatment specificity. Previous studies have reported that personality traits predict and influence the course and treatment response of depression. The Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (T&P) assesses eight major constructs of personality traits observed in those who develop depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of T&P's eight constructs on the treatment outcome of depressed patients. A preliminary 6-month prospective study was conducted with a sample of 51 adult patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) without remarkable psychomotor disturbance using the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>, fourth edition. All patients received comprehensive assessment including the T&P at baseline. We compared each T&P construct score between patients who achieved remission and those who did not achieve remission after 6 months of treatment for depression using both subjective and objective measures. All 51 (100%) patients received the 6-month follow-up assessment. This study demonstrated that higher scores on T&P personal reserve predicted poorer treatment outcome in patients with MDD. Higher levels of personal reserve, rejection sensitivity, and self-criticism correlated with higher levels of depression. Higher levels of rejection sensitivity and self-criticism were associated with non-remitters; however, when we controlled for baseline depression severity, this relationship did not show significance. Although the results are preliminary, this study suggests that high scores on T&P personal reserve predict poorer treatment outcome and T&P rejection sensitivity and self-criticism correlate with the severity of depression. Longer follow-up studies with large sample sizes are required to improve the understanding of these relationships.",2017,Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,,2017,YES,sa,Which personality trait assessed by the Temperament and Personality Questionnaire (T&P) is most strongly associated with poorer treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder?,High personal reserve.,"The abstract states that higher scores on T&P personal reserve predict poorer treatment outcomes in patients with major depressive disorder, making it the most strongly associated trait with non-remission."

29223176,The Influence of Exposure to Natural Disasters on Depression and PTSD Symptoms among Firefighters.,"Introduction Firefighters represent an important population for understanding the consequences of exposure to potentially traumatic stressors. Hypothesis/Problem The researchers were interested in the effects of pre-employment disaster exposure on firefighter recruits' depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the first three years of fire service and hypothesized that: (1) disaster-exposed firefighters would have greater depression and PTSD symptoms than non-exposed overall; and (2) depression and PTSD symptoms would worsen over years in fire service in exposed firefighters, but not in their unexposed counterparts. In a baseline interview, 35 male firefighter recruits from seven US cities reported lifetime exposure to natural disaster. These disaster-exposed male firefighter recruits were matched on age, city, and education with non-exposed recruits. A generalized linear mixed model revealed a significant exposure×time interaction (e coef =1.04; P<.001), such that depression symptoms increased with time for those with pre-employment disaster exposure only. This pattern persisted after controlling for social support from colleagues (e coefficient=1.05; P<.001), social support from families (e coefficient=1.04; P=.001), and on-the-job trauma exposure (coefficient=0.06; e coefficient=1.11; P<.001). Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms did not vary significantly between exposure groups at baseline (P=.61). Depression symptoms increased with time for those with pre-employment disaster exposure only, even after controlling for social support.

29057596,The Anaclitic-Introjective Depression Assessment: Development and preliminary validity of an observer-rated measure.,"The two-configurations model developed by Blatt and colleagues offers a comprehensive conceptual and empirical framework for understanding depression. This model suggests that depressed patients struggle, at different developmental levels, with issues related to dependency (anaclitic issues) or self-definition (introjective issues), or a combination of both. This paper reports three studies on the development and preliminary validation of the Anaclitic-Introjective Depression Assessment, an observer-rated assessment tool of impairments in relatedness and self-definition in clinical depression based on the item pool of the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure. Study 1 describes the development of the measure using expert consensus rating and Q-methodology. Studies 2 and 3 report the assessment of its psychometric properties, preliminary reliability, and validity in a sample of 128 patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. Four naturally occurring clusters of depressed patients were identified using Q-factor analysis, which, overall, showed meaningful and theoretically expected relationships with anaclitic/introjective prototypes as formulated by experts, as well as with clinical, social, occupational, global, and relational functioning. Taken together, findings reported in this paper provide preliminary evidence for the reliability and validity of the Anaclitic-Introjective Depression Assessment, an observer-rated measure that allows the detection of important nuanced differentiations between and within anaclitic and introjective depression.",2018-Mar,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,,2017,YES,sa,What are the two primary developmental issues that may underlie clinical depression and how can they manifest in patients?,"Dependency (anaclitic issues) and self-definition (introjective issues); they manifest as impairments in relatedness or self-definition, or a combination of both.","The abstract states that depression involves struggles with dependency or self-definition, described as anaclitic and introjective issues, which affect relatedness and self-definition at different developmental levels."
29179144,The centrality of DSM and non-DSM depressive symptoms in Han Chinese women with major depression.,"We compared DSM-IV criteria for major depression (MD) with clinically selected non-DSM criteria in their ability to represent clinical features of depression. We conducted network analyses of 19 DSM and non-DSM symptoms of MD assessed at personal interview in 5952 Han Chinese women meeting DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MD. We estimated an Ising model (the state-of-the-art network model for binary data), compared the centrality (interconnectedness) of DSM-IV and non-DSM symptoms, and investigated the community structure (symptoms strongly clustered together). The DSM and non-DSM criteria were intermingled within the same symptom network. In both the DSM-IV and non-DSM criteria sets, some symptoms were central (highly interconnected) while others were more peripheral. The mean centrality of the DSM and non-DSM criteria sets did not significantly differ. In at least two cases, non-DSM criteria were more central than symptomatically related DSM criteria: lowered libido vs. sleep and appetite changes, and hopelessness versus worthlessness. The overall network had three sub-clusters reflecting neurovegetative/mood symptoms, cognitive changes and anxiety/irritability. The sample were severely ill Han Chinese females limiting generalizability. Consistent with prior historical reviews, our results suggest that the DSM-IV criteria for MD reflect one possible sub-set of a larger pool of plausible depressive symptoms and signs. While the DSM criteria on average perform well, they are not unique and may not be optimal in their ability to describe the depressive syndrome.",2018-Feb,Journal of affective disorders,,2017,YES,sa,Which depressive symptom is more central in its network structure: hopelessness or worthlessness?,Hopelessness.,The abstract states that hopelessness is more central than the symptomatically related DSM-IV criterion of worthlessness in the network analysis of depressive symptoms.
28789727,Food-based diet quality score in relation to depressive symptoms in young and middle-aged Japanese women.,"Only a few studies have focused on the association between overall diet, rather than intakes of individual nutrients or foods, and depressive symptoms in Japanese. This cross-sectional study examined associations between a diet quality score and depressive symptoms in 3963 young (age 18 years) and 3833 middle-aged (mean age 47·9 (sd 4·2) years) Japanese women. Dietary information was collected using a diet history questionnaire. A previously developed diet quality score was computed mainly based on the Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 22·0 % for young women and 16·8 % for middle-aged women, assessed as a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) score ≥23 and ≥19, respectively. As expected, the diet quality score was associated positively with intakes of 'grain dishes', 'vegetable dishes', 'fish and meat dishes', 'milk' and 'fruits' and inversely with intakes of energy from 'snacks, confection and beverages' and Na from seasonings. After adjustment for potential confounders, OR for depressive symptoms in the highest v. lowest quintiles of the diet quality score was 0·65 (95 % CI 0·50, 0·84) in young women (P for trend=0·0005). In middle-aged women, the corresponding value was 0·59 (95 % CI 0·45, 0·78) (P for trend<0·0001). Analyses where the diet quality and CES-D scores were treated as continuous variables also showed inverse associations. In conclusion, this cross-sectional study showed that a higher diet quality score was associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms in young and middle-aged Japanese women.

27677168,Effects of depression and anxiety on antiretroviral therapy adherence among newly diagnosed HIV-infected Chinese MSM.,"Our objective was to explore the effect of depression and anxiety on adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among MSM with newly diagnosed HIV infections. We conducted a prospective study of Chinese MSM with newly diagnosed HIV infections. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to measure depression and anxiety at baseline, 6 and 12 months, separately. ART adherence was self-reported once every 3 months ('perfect' or no missing dose in the past 3 months vs. 'imperfect' adherence or at least one missing dose in the past 3 months). We utilized a priori substantial knowledge guided by causal models to identify confounding covariates, and performed mixed-effect logistic regression to assess the effects of depression and anxiety on ART adherence. We included 228 participants who initiated ART after HIV diagnosis and before the end of study. A one-unit increase in the depression and anxiety score was associated with a 16% increase [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.32] and a 17% increase (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.33) in the odds of reporting imperfect ART adherence, respectively. When depression and anxiety were categorized (normal, borderline, and likely), only likely anxiety had a significant association with imperfect ART adherence (aOR, 4.79; 95% CI, 1.12-20.50). Depression and anxiety are risk factors for imperfect ART adherence among Chinese MSM with newly diagnosed HIV infections.

28634202,Hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> Variability Predicts Symptoms of Depression in Elderly Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes.,"This study aimed to analyze the relationship of variability in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) over years with subsequent depressive symptoms. Subjects (<i>n</i> = 837) were participants of the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline (IDCD) study, which aimed to examine the relationship of characteristics of long-term type 2 diabetes with cognitive decline. All pertain to a diabetes registry established in 1998, which contains an average of 18 HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements per subject. The results presented here are based on the IDCD baseline examination. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). To quantify the association between variability in glycemic control (measured as the SD of HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements [HbA<sub>1c</sub>-SD]) since 1998 with the number of depression symptoms at IDCD baseline, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated via negative binomial regression modeling and used to account for the overdispersion in GDS scores. Subjects' ages averaged 72.74 years (SD 4.63 years), and the mean number of years in the diabetes registry was 8.7 (SD 2.64 years). The mean GDS score was 2.16 (SD 2.26); 10% of subjects had a GDS score ≥6, the cutoff for clinically significant depression. Mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> significantly correlated with HbA<sub>1c</sub>-SD (<i>r</i> = 0.6625; <i>P</i> < 0.0001). The SD, but not the mean, of HbA<sub>1c</sub> measurements was significantly associated with the number of subsequent depressive symptoms. For each additional 1% increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub>-SD, the number of depressive symptoms increased by a factor of 1.31 (IRR = 1.31 [95% CI 1.03-1.67]; <i>P</i> = 0.03).

28920038,Comparing the Effect of Preoperative Administration of Melatonin and <i>Passiflora incarnata</i> on Postoperative Cognitive Disorders in Adult Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery.,"Anxiety is a preoperative complication, which most patients encounter. The use of a premedication to reduce preoperative anxiety with minimal cognitive impairment is crucial. This study was conducted to compare the sedative effect of preoperative melatonin and <i>Passiflora incarnata</i> in patients undergoing elective surgery regarding their potential for postoperative cognitive disorders. In this clinical trial, 52 patients American society of anesthesiologists grade (ASA) I and II of both genders were selected to receive either <i>Passiflora incarnata</i> (1000 mg nature made) (n = 26) or melatonin (6 mg) (n = 26) as premedication one hour before surgery. Post-operative pain was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Patient's anxiety and cognitive dysfunction was evaluated with the Ramsey score and the digital symbol substitution test (DSST), respectively. All tests were carried out and evaluated at arrival in the operating room, before induction and before discharge from the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). There were no statistically differences between groups in VAS (P > 0.05). However, the mean score of pain was higher in the melatonin group compared to the <i>Pssiflora incarnata</i> group when discharged from the PACU (27.63 vs. 25.37). The anxiety scores were statistically significant in both drugs (P = 0.001), however higher sedation scores was caused by premedication with melatonin (P = 0.003 vs. 0.008). Regarding the DSST, there was a significant difference between the two groups one hour before the surgery (P = 0.04) and at the time of discharge from the PACU (P = 0.007). When evaluating each group, the <i>Passiflora incarnata</i> group revealed a significant difference (P = 0.003). Our findings show that premedication with <i>Passiflora incarnata</i> reduces anxiety as well as Melatonin.

29136603,Prolonged grief reactions after old age spousal loss and centrality of the loss in post loss identity.,"The loss of a spouse is a major life event. Previous research found that centrality of the loss to one's identity using Centrality of Event Scale (CES) is related to complicated bereavement reactions, such as depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS), and prolonged grief symptoms (PGS). This study aims to examine loss-centrality in elderly bereaved people up to 4 years post loss, to determine the relation of loss-centrality to complicated bereavement reactions, such as PGS, depression, and PTS, and to identify early predictors of loss-centrality. Self-reported data were collected from 208 elderly bereaved people (mean age 72 years, 63.9% women), who completed measures of psychological distress (PTS, depression, PGS) as well as intra- and interpersonal factors (coping-style, crisis support, satisfaction with life, and NEO-PI-R) at 2, 6, and 48 months post spousal loss. CES was measured 48 months post spousal loss. In line with previous findings (Boelen, 2012a), loss-centrality 4 years following the loss was significantly related to depression, PTS, and PGS. Additionally, early PGS and gender predicted later loss-centrality. Self-repport data was used rather than clinical interviews. CES was only measured 48 months post loss. PGS was first measured 6 months post. The results support the link between loss-centrality and post loss psychopathology in a population particularly vulnerable to complicated bereavement reactions. The close link between prolonged grief and CES may be relevant in developing treatments for PGS, especially considering the potential relationship between high CES, high PGS, and possibly lack of acceptance of the loss.",2018-Feb,Journal of affective disorders,,2017,YES,sa,"What factors measured early after spousal loss may predict higher centrality of the loss to identity four years later, and how might this relate to depression or anxiety disorders?","Early prolonged grief symptoms (PGS) and female gender predict higher loss-centrality, which is linked to depression, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS), and prolonged grief symptoms.","The abstract identifies early PGS and gender as predictors of later loss-centrality, which is associated with depression, PTS, and PGS, indicating their relevance to post-loss psychopathology and potential treatment targets."

This study attempts to elucidate variables that might mediate the relation between symptoms of depression and stress and alcohol problems, including alcohol demand, future time orientation, and craving. Participants were 393 undergraduates (60.8% female, 78.9% White/Caucasian) who reported at least 2 binge-drinking episodes (4/5+ drinks for women/men, respectively) in the previous month. Participants completed self-report measures of stress and depression, alcohol demand, future time orientation, craving, and alcohol problems. In separate mediation models that accounted for gender, race, and weekly alcohol consumption, future orientation and craving significantly mediated the relation between depressive symptoms and alcohol problems. Alcohol demand, future orientation, and craving significantly mediated the relation between stress symptoms and alcohol problems. Heavy-drinking young adults who experience stress or depression are likely to experience alcohol problems, and this is due in part to elevations in craving and alcohol demand, and less sensitivity to future outcomes.

27555379,Genetic Contributions of Inflammation to Depression.,"This paper describes the effects of immune genes genetic variants and mRNA expression on depression's risk, severity, and response to antidepressant treatment, through a systematic review on all papers published between 2000 and 2016. Our results, based largely on case-control studies, suggest that common genetic variants and gene-expression pathways are involved in both immune activation and depression. The most replicated and relevant genetic variants include polymorphisms in the genes for interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and phospholipase A2. Moreover, increased blood cytokines mRNA expression (especially of IL-1β) identifies patients that are less likely to respond to conventional antidepressants. However, even for the most replicated findings there are inconsistent results, not only between studies, but also between the immune effects of the genetic variants and the resulting effects on depression. We find evidence that these discrepant findings may be explained, at least in part, by the heterogeneity of the depression immunophenotype, by environmental influences and gene × environment interactions, and by the complex interfacing of genetic variants with gene expression. Indeed, some of the most robust findings have been obtained in patients developing depression in the context of treatment with interferon-alpha, a widely used model to mimic depression in the context of inflammation. Further 'omics' approaches, through GWAS and transcriptomics, will finally shed light on the interaction between immune genes, their expression, and the influence of the environment, in the pathogenesis of depression.",2017-Jan,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,,2017,YES,sa,Which cytokine's increased mRNA expression is associated with reduced likelihood of responding to conventional antidepressants?,Interleukin-1β (IL-1β).,"The abstract states that increased blood cytokine mRNA expression, particularly IL-1β, identifies patients less likely to respond to conventional antidepressants."
28895092,Neural response to evaluating depression predicts perceivers' mental health treatment recommendations.,"Nonstigmatized perceivers' initial evaluations of stigmatized individuals have profound consequences for the well-being of those stigmatized individuals. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains underexplored. Specifically, what beliefs about the stigmatized condition (stigma-related beliefs) shape how nonstigmatized perceivers evaluate and behave toward stigmatized individuals? We examined these questions with respect to depression-related stigmatization because depression is highly stigmatized and nondepressed individuals' behavior (e.g., willingness to recommend treatment) directly relates to removing stigma and increasing well-being. In Study 1, we identified common stigma-related beliefs associated with depression (e.g., not a serious illness, controllable, threatening), and found that only perceptions that depression is a serious condition predicted nondepressed perceivers' willingness to recommend mental health treatment. Moreover, perceivers' beliefs that depression is a distressing condition mediated the relationship between perceived seriousness and treatment recommendations (Study 1). In Study 2, we used fMRI to disentangle the potential processes connecting distress to nondepressed perceivers' self-reported treatment intentions. Heightened activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)-a region widely implicated in evaluating others-and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)-a region widely implicated in regulating negative emotions-emerged when nondepressed perceivers evaluated individuals who were ostensibly depressed.

15213794,Comparison of 3 Depression Screening Methods and Provider Referral in a Veterans Affairs Primary Care Clinic.,"BACKGROUND: Concern about underdiagnosis and undertreatment of depression in primary care has led to support for routine screening. Although multiple screening instruments exist, we are not aware of studies to date that have compared different screening strategies, e.g., how the instrument is administered: by whom and in what setting. This study compared 3 separate screening strategies in terms of patient flow, coverage, patient characteristics, and other factors with the usual care system of provider referral. METHOD: We analyzed existing data from a completed randomized team trial of collaborative care depression treatment in which patients who met DSM-IV criteria for current major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, or both were recruited using the usual care system of provider referral (provider) and 3 separate screening strategies: (1) a 2-stage waiting room screening interview (waiting), (2) an in-clinic screen consisting of 2 self-report items embedded in a larger survey (in-clinic), and (3) a 2-stage self-report mail survey (mail). The team trial and analysis were conducted between January 1998 and July 2003. RESULTS: The usual care system of provider referral identified the most depressed patients and had relatively good coverage compared with the 3 screening strategies. Of the 3 screening strategies, the in-clinic strategy had the best coverage, while the mail strategy had the worst coverage. Provider referral patients were younger and had fewer chronic medical illnesses than did other patients. The waiting strategy identified more patients with bipolar affective disorder.

12823655,Conceptual models of psychological distress among low-income patients in an inner-city primary care clinic.,"Although depression and anxiety syndromes are common in primary care, many depressed and anxious patients fail to receive effective treatment. Little attention has been given to the role of illness beliefs in shaping these patients' treatment preferences and decisions. Using semistructured interviews, this study examined conceptual models of depressive symptoms among patients in an inner-city clinic. A theoretical taxonomy of patients' conceptual models of distress was developed: each category was associated with a unique pattern of treatment preferences. We conclude that patients' models of distress may play an important role in treatment-seeking decisions, and deserve further investigation.",2003-Jun,Journal of general internal medicine,Journal Article,2003,YES,sa,How might a patient's conceptual model of their depressive symptoms influence their treatment preferences?,"Patients' conceptual models of distress are associated with unique treatment preferences, influencing their decisions about seeking care.","The abstract highlights that patients' beliefs about their symptoms shape their treatment preferences and decisions, suggesting that understanding these models is crucial for tailoring effective interventions."
14526884,Assessing the independent contribution to quality of life from anxiety and depression in patients with advanced cancer.,"The aim of palliative care services is to ensure the best quality of life for patients and their carers. Depression is common amongst palliative care patients and has been shown to adversely affect quality of life. This study aimed to examine the independent contribution of depression to quality of life. To investigate the hypothesis that a) illness severity, pain, anxiety and depression are all associated with impaired health-related quality of life and b) once the effects of illness severity have been adjusted for, there is further independent contribution to quality of life from anxiety and depression. Consecutive patients with advanced cancer under the care of palliative care services were screened. Sixty-eight patients were evaluated for levels of anxiety and depression, severity of illness, pain severity and health-related quality of life. Thirty-three males and 35 females were recruited and had an age range of 41-93 years (median 71). Seventeen (25%) of patients were anxious [anxiety score > or = 11 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], 15 (22%) were depressed (HADS depression score > or = 11). After controlling for the effects of pain and illness severity, anxiety and depression were independently associated with global health status, emotional and cognitive functioning, and fatigue. Anxiety further contributed significantly towards social functioning, nausea and vomiting. This study has confirmed that pain, anxiety and depression were associated with impaired quality of life. Anxiety and depression contributed independently towards various dimensions of quality of life. Longitudinal studies are required to examine the direction of the causal association between pain and depression in patients receiving palliative care.",2003-Sep,Palliative medicine,Journal Article,2003,YES,sa,"In patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative care, how might depression independently impact cognitive functioning despite controlling for illness severity and pain?",Depression is independently associated with impaired cognitive functioning.,"The abstract states that after controlling for illness severity and pain, depression independently contributes to cognitive functioning, indicating its specific role in affecting this dimension of quality of life in palliative care patients."
12439628,Baseline prolactin and L-tryptophan availability predict response to antidepressant treatment in major depression.,"Depression may be associated with a hypofunction of central serotonin (5HT) systems. The prolactin response to fenfluramine (PRF) is an indicator of 5HT activity. It has been suggested that the PRF may predict response to different forms of treatment. Baseline cortisol, prolactin, and L-tryptophan ( L-TRP) availability may affect PRF and may also influence response to treatment. In this study, 46 males and 58 females with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression underwent a detailed clinical evaluation and prior to treatment had baseline measures of prolactin, cortisol, L-TRP, and other large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) taken and underwent a fenfluramine challenge. The subjects with major depression entered a 6-week double-blind treatment trial comparing clomipramine and desipramine. There was no effect on the 6-week outcome of treatment (clomipramine versus desipramine), PRF or baseline cortisol and no interactions between these factors. However, there was a significant effect of baseline prolactin (BLP) and a significant interaction between TRP/LNAA ratio and BLP. Post-hoc analysis revealed that at low TRP/LNAA values, outcome improved as prolactin levels increased while at high TRP/LNAA values the opposite was the case. The PRF did not predict 6-week outcome. BLP and TRP/LNAA ratio measurement is easy and may be useful clinically. We hypothesise that failure to upregulate post-synaptic 5HT receptors in response to low 5HT availability predicts a poor response to antidepressant treatment.",2003-Jan,Psychopharmacology,"Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2003,YES,sa,How might baseline prolactin levels and the TRP/LNAA ratio interact to influence antidepressant treatment outcomes in major depression?,"At low TRP/LNAA ratios, higher baseline prolactin predicts better outcomes; at high TRP/LNAA ratios, higher baseline prolactin predicts worse outcomes.","The abstract shows a significant interaction where TRP/LNAA ratio and baseline prolactin levels jointly influence treatment response, with opposite effects depending on TRP/LNAA ratio values."
12837849,"Effects of dietary n-3 or n-6 fatty acids on interleukin-1beta-induced anxiety, stress, and inflammatory responses in rats.","The present study demonstrated that an omega (n)-3 fatty acid, ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (ethyl-EPA), supplemented diet significantly attenuated the stress/anxiety behavior of rats in the ""open field"" and elevated plus maze, which was induced by subchronic intracerebroventricular administration of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta. Ethyl-EPA also reduced the rise in serum corticosterone induced by IL-1. The n-6 fatty acid ethyl-gamma-linolenic acid (ethyl-GLA) had little effect on the IL-1-induced changes in behavior and the corticosterone concentration. Following IL-1beta administration, ethyl-EPA reduced the elevated prostaglandin (PG) E2 secretion and increased the secretion of antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 from whole blood cells. Ethyl-GLA showed a similar antiinflammatory effect to ethyl-EPA. By contrast, n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) had no effect on the behavior, immune, and endocrine changes induced by IL-1. AA alone enhanced the basal inflammatory response, raised serum corticosterone concentrations, and induced anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze. The reduced growth rates of rats following the administration of IL-1 was attenuated by ethyl-EPA, and to a greater extent by ethyl-EPA plus ethyl-GLA, but not by AA alone or in combination with ethyl-EPA. Thus, ethyl-EPA would appear to antagonise the endocrine, immune, and behavioral effects of subchronic IL-1 administration. Ethyl-GLA only antagonised IL-1-induced inflammatory changes, whereas AA caused an increase in the secretion of corticosterone and PGE2, and induced anxiety-like behavior without enhancing the effects of IL-1.",2003-Oct,Journal of lipid research,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2003,YES,sa,"Which omega fatty acid supplementation could be considered to mitigate anxiety-like behaviors and stress responses associated with elevated proinflammatory cytokines, and why?",Ethyl-EPA.,"Ethyl-EPA reduces IL-1-induced anxiety behaviors, corticosterone levels, and inflammatory markers (PGE2), while increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10.

12778841,Predictors of response in anxiety disorders.,"Anxiety disorder variables such as duration, severity of illness, and comorbidity with other anxiety or mood disorders appear to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk of treatment nonresponse. Conversely, in accord with clinical experience, shorter periods of illness, less severe illness, being treatment naive, and the absence of comorbidity tend to identify patients who are likely to respond robustly to medication management. Symptom clusters in OCD and PTSD are promising as a means of stratifying those more likely to respond to standard pharmacologic treatment. The presence of hoarding or sexual obsessions seems to presage poorer response in OCD, while the presence of dissociative symptoms in PTSD has been linked to high nonspecific treatment response rates to placebo. Genotyping individuals with respect to genes that are thought to have an important role in the underlying disease process, such as the work with the 5HTTL-PR allele, is exciting and is perhaps the first glimmer of using genotyping to identify treatment strategies or to predict the likelihood or speed of response. The use of neuroimaging as a means of identifying individuals who may respond favorably to pharmacologic or neurosurgical intervention is still in its infancy. As a strategy, it may help combine symptom severity and response variables into a clear neurobiologic vulnerability model of illness. In the future, it may be possible to identify specific treatment interventions for specific patterns of abnormal metabolic rates in certain areas of the brain. However, it should be emphasized that such an approach has not been empirically demonstrated in a rigorous experimental context at this time.",2003-Jun,The Psychiatric clinics of North America,Journal Article; Review,2003,YES,sa,What factors in a patient with generalized anxiety disorder might predict a robust response to pharmacologic treatment?,"Shorter illness duration, less severe symptoms, treatment-naive status, absence of comorbid mood or anxiety disorders.","The abstract states that shorter illness duration, less severity, being treatment-naive, and no comorbidity are associated with a strong response to medication in anxiety disorders."

We then searched for risk-groups by studying all answers obtained with the ad hoc questionnaire and looking for those answers that were significantly correlated with ratings of psychopathology. To carry out this search, we used first and second order principal components factor analysis. Our results show that the incidence of depression is almost twice as high among students that have withdrawn from an exam session than among the other students in our sample. It is further possible to determine that, in our sample, it is not withdrawing from an exam session that causes depression but, rather, it is depression that increases the probability of withdrawing from an exam session.

12798983,Axis III disorders in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.,"A number of naturalistic studies have found that medical co-morbidity conveys a worse long-term prognosis in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of this study was to test whether the presence of co-morbid medical conditions can predict clinical response in patients with treatment-resistant MDD (TRD) treated with open-label nortriptyline (NT). Ninety-two patients with TRD entered a 6-week open trial of NT. The presence of co-morbid medical disorders was assessed during the screen visit. The degree of medical co-morbidity during the screen visit was then quantified with the use of the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric Version (CIRS(G)). We tested whether CIRS(G) scores predicted clinical response or depression severity at endpoint. CIRS scores at baseline did not significantly predict treatment response. The results of this study fail to confirm the relationship between co-morbid medical conditions and poor outcome in the treatment of MDD for patients with TRD. Patients with TRD and co-morbid medical conditions can be expected to respond to antidepressants as well as their counterparts without concurrent axis III co-morbidity. The CIRS(G) scores for this TRD sample were lower than those reported for geriatric depression, or for depressed patients with severe medical illness, common in medical and surgical wards and in most specialty clinics of large academic centers.

14677084,"Lithium augmentation in treatment-resistant depression: clinical evidence, serotonergic and endocrine mechanisms.","For now more than 50 years, lithium has been the gold standard for the pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder. However, its utility is not restricted to acute mania and prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder. A relatively new indication for its use is the addition to an antidepressant in the acute treatment phase of unipolar major depression. To date, this treatment approach called lithium augmentation is the best-documented approach in the treatment of refractory depression. In international treatment guidelines and algorithms, lithium augmentation is considered a first-line treatment strategy for patients with a major depressive episode who do not adequately respond to standard antidepressant treatment. In a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, lithium augmentation has demonstrated to also be effective in the continuation treatment phase to prevent early relapses. From animal studies there is robust evidence that lithium augmentation increases serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission, possibly by a synergistic action of lithium and the antidepressant on brain 5-HT pathways. In contrast to the established decline of HPA system activity during treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, neuroendocrine studies on the effects of lithium augmentation on the HPA system showed an unexpected and marked increase in the ACTH and cortisol response in the combined DEX/CRH test.

Hence, the study of the anxiolytic effects of nicotine is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction. Mammalian nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha andbeta subunits. Taking advantage of beta4-homozygous-null mice (beta4-/-), we examined the role of the nAChR beta4 subunit in anxiety-related behaviors. The beta4-/- mice behaved as though they were less anxious than wild-type littermates on the elevated-plus and staircase mazes, tests that measure anxiety-related behaviors. To obtain an independent, physiological indication of the stress produced by several tests, we measured changes in heart rate using telemetry. Consistently with the behavioral phenotype, beta4-/- mice had a smaller heart rate increase in the elevated-plus maze than did wild-type littermates. In contrast, during social isolation, a separate test for anxiety,beta4-/- mice exhibited a greater increase in heart rate than did wild-type littermates. Finally, beta4-/- mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates in the open field, the light/dark box, and the mirrored chamber. The overall results demonstrate that beta4-containing (beta4*) nAChRs influence behavioral responses during anxiety-related tests, and that this effect depends on the type of anxiety-provoking experience. Through their influence on anxiety-related behavior, beta4* nAChRs might influence both tobacco consumption and smoking relapse.",2003-Jul-16,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2003,YES,sa,How might the beta4 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors influence anxiety-related behaviors differently depending on the type of anxiety-provoking experience?,Beta4-containing nAChRs reduce anxiety in elevated-plus maze tests but increase physiological stress during social isolation.,"Beta4-/- mice showed less anxiety and smaller heart rate increases in elevated-plus maze tests but greater heart rate increases during social isolation, indicating context-dependent effects of beta4-containing nAChRs on anxiety behaviors."
15131518,"Continuation treatment of chronic depression: a comparison of nefazodone, cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy, and their combination.","Little is known about the relative benefits of psychotherapy, medication, and combined treatment as continuation therapies for chronic forms of major depressive disorder (MDD) after a positive response to acute treatment. We hypothesize that combined treatment would demonstrate superior continuation phase outcomes compared to either monotherapy, as evidenced by lower relapse rates and greater rates of improvement from partial to full remission. We report 16-week continuation phase outcomes for 324 patients who had participated in either the acute phase of a randomized multicenter trial of nefazodone, Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP), or combination therapy (COMB) for chronic forms of MDD. Patients entering the continuation phase had either fully or partially remitted after 12 weeks of acute phase treatment. The primary efficacy measure was the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. For patients in remission at acute phase exit, 73.3% (107/146) maintained their remitted status at endpoint of the continuation phase. Of those having a partial remission at acute phase exit, 52.9% (92/174) achieved full remission by end of continuation. A greater proportion of patients maintained a partial or full remission status on COMB (90%) compared to nefazodone (80%, p=0.011) or to CBASP (82%, p=0.042). These differences reflected greater symptom re-emergence in the partial remission groups on CBASP and nefazodone monotherapy compared to COMB. Continuation treatment assignment was not randomized or blinded. There was no placebo group. Most patients with chronic forms of MDD sustained their acute phase response and more than 50% of partial remitters achieved full remission while continuing treatment with nefazodone, CBASP, or COMB. COMB was associated with less symptom re-emergence during the continuation phase than either monotherapy, particularly for partial remitters.",2003,Psychopharmacology bulletin,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2003,YES,sa,Which continuation therapy for chronic major depressive disorder is most effective at preventing symptom re-emergence in partial remitters?,Combination therapy (COMB).,"COMB had less symptom re-emergence during continuation compared to nefazodone or CBASP, especially in partial remitters, where 90% maintained remission or achieved full remission."

We used regression analysis to examine age differences in women with depression in 2 birth cohorts, pre-1945 and post-1944, who were assessed at comparable ages. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate changes with age in successive birth year cohorts. An age by cohort interaction indicated more depression among younger than older women in the post-1944 cohort but a flat age profile in the pre-1945 cohort.

12633893,Influence of a functional polymorphism within the angiotensin I-converting enzyme gene on partial sleep deprivation in patients with major depression.,"Partial sleep deprivation (PSD) exerts transient antidepressant efficacy. As a potential mechanism of action an enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission within the CNS is discussed. Because genetic variations influencing neurotransmission could have an impact on therapeutic outcome and stability of improvement, we investigated the functional insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene to examine a possible influence on the dopaminergic pathway. We included 56 patients with major depression (DSM-IV). Psychiatric ratings including the HAM-D6 scale were assessed prior to and after PSD and related to the different genotypes. The ACE I/D polymorphism was determined following PCR amplification using genomic DNA. A total of 58.1% of the patients were PSD responders. As expected, the therapeutical effect of PSD was transient and most patients experienced an exacerbation of depressive symptoms on day 2. Subdivision according ACE gene variants showed a significantly less pronounced relapse of symptoms in ACE gene D-allele carriers (P=0.02). Our results give first hints that the ACE I/I genotype, probably influencing dopaminergic neurotransmission, could be an indicator for relapse after PSD. This should result in earlier and more intense additional therapeutic interventions in this group of patients.",2003-Mar-27,Neuroscience letters,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2003,YES,sa,How might the ACE I/I genotype influence relapse patterns following partial sleep deprivation in patients with major depression?,The ACE I/I genotype is associated with a more pronounced relapse of depressive symptoms following partial sleep deprivation.,"The abstract suggests that ACE gene D-allele carriers experience less severe symptom relapse, implying the ACE I/I genotype may heighten relapse due to its potential influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission."
14736017,Psychosocial factors and quality of life in young hemodialysis patients with low comorbidity.,"The current predominance of older patients, diabetic patients and high-comorbidity patients among the hemodialysis (HD) population has probably influenced the definition of the effects of renal disease on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and these effects can be different in the patient subgroup without these characteristics. This multicenter study aimed to assess HRQOL in non-diabetic HD patients, aged < 65 yrs and with low comorbidity, and to study the effects of the demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics on their HRQOL. 117 patients from 43 Spanish HD centers participated in the study. Patients completed the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short-Form questionnaire (KDQOL-SF) and screening for depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and social support. Various sociodemographic and clinical variables were also recorded. HD patients' HRQOL showed a profile similar to that of the general HD population, with low physical health scores, but normal mental health scores. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that gender, older age, non-working status, low social support and low levels of hemoglobin (Hb), Kt/V or protein catabolic rate (PCR), had a negative effects, but these effects were of relatively small magnitude and appeared only in some scales. The most important independent predictors of HRQOL were anxiety state and depressive symptoms. In non-diabetic HD patients, aged < or = 65 yrs and with low comorbidity, psychological factors (anxiety state and depressive symptoms) are crucial HRQOL determinants.

14504737,Social representations of major depression in West and East Germany--do differences still persist 11 years after reunification?,"In a population survey that was carried out in 1990, differences between the former Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were observed with regard to the social representation of depression. Back then, we predicted that in a few years these differences would have reduced. To test this hypothesis, a second survey was conducted in 2001. In 1990, a representative survey was carried out in both parts of Germany. A total of 3,098 personal, fully structured interviews were completed, 2,118 in West Germany and 980 in East Germany. The survey was repeated in 2001 using the same measures. This time, 5,025 interviews were conducted, 4,005 in West Germany and 1,020 in East Germany. While in 1990 there had been numerous differences between the two parts of Germany with regard to the social representation of depression, in 2001 most of these differences had disappeared. Lay concepts of depression held by interviewees from East Germany have assimilated to those held by interviewees from West Germany. In both parts of Germany, a marked change in favor of biological conceptualizations of depression was observable, with heredity and brain disease more frequently being seen as a cause in 2001. The hypothesis that the differences between lay concepts of depression that were prevalent in West and East Germany in 1990 would have reduced by 2001 was supported by our results. Our study shows that cultural processes, such as the process of acculturation that took place in Germany between 1990 and 2001, have an effect on the social representation of mental disorders.",2003-Sep,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2003,YES,sa,What cultural process might explain a shift toward biological conceptualizations of depression in a population over time?,Acculturation.,"The abstract indicates that acculturation influenced the assimilation of lay concepts of depression in East Germany to those in West Germany, including a shift toward biological explanations like heredity and brain disease."

Patients (n = 85) who had completed treatment for SAD, generalized anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia 7.42 years earlier (on average) were reassessed using structured diagnostic interviews. Subjects with a childhood diagnosis of SAD did not display a greater risk for developing panic disorder and agoraphobia in young adulthood than those with other childhood anxiety diagnoses. Subjects with a childhood diagnosis of SAD did not more frequently meet full diagnostic criteria for panic disorder and agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, or major depressive disorder in adulthood than subjects with childhood diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder or social phobia, but were more likely to meet criteria for other anxiety disorders (i.e., specific phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and acute stress disorder).

This multicentre study assessed health-related quality of life and symptom experience in renal transplant patients on tacrolimus-based therapy, using the SF-36 and Euroqol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) and the 'modified transplant symptom occurrence and symptom distress scale', respectively. Symptoms of depression were assessed with the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory and physical activity with the Baecke questionnaire. Overall, 350 patients with a median post-transplant status of 16.7 months were enrolled. Results revealed that patients experienced lower SF-36 scores than the general population, except in terms of bodily pain. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that a higher degree of depressive symptoms and female gender were consistently related to a health status perceived as being worse and a higher rate of symptom experience. These findings are in accordance with previous quality-of-life reports that assessed patients under various immunosuppressive therapies. Therefore, interventions, including the screening and treatment for depression and the addressing of gender-specific issues, can enhance quality of life.",2003-Sep,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,"Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2003,YES,sa,"In renal transplant patients on tacrolimus-based therapy, what two patient-related factors are most consistently associated with worse perceived health status and higher symptom burden?",Higher depressive symptoms and female gender.,The abstract identifies higher depressive symptoms and female gender as factors consistently linked to worse perceived health status and greater symptom burden in renal transplant patients on tacrolimus-based therapy.
12871583,Differential neurochemical properties of central serotonergic transmission in Roman high- and low-avoidance rats.,"The selective breeding of Roman high- (RHA/Verh) and low-avoidance (RLA/Verh) rats for rapid versus poor acquisition of active avoidant behaviour has produced two behavioural phenotypes with different performances in a variety of animal models of anxiety, in which RLA/Verh rats are consistently more fearful than RHA/Verh rats. In addition, these two lines display different functional properties of brain neurotransmitters like serotonin (5-HT), known to be involved in the expression of anxiety- and depression-related behaviours. Therefore, we used brain microdialysis and [3H]-citalopram binding autoradiography to characterize further the neurochemical properties of 5-HTergic transmission in the two lines. No significant line-related differences were detected in the basal 5-HT output in the frontoparietal cortex (FPCx). In contrast, the increase in the cortical 5-HT output elicited by the systemic administration or the local application, via reverse dialysis, of chlorimipramine and fluoxetine was more robust in RHA/Verh than in RLA/Verh rats. Moreover, the binding signal of [3H]-citalopram to 5-HT re-uptake sites was more intense in the FPCx of RHA/Verh rats than in their RLA/Verh counterparts. These findings suggest that the functional tone of the 5-HTergic projection to the FPCx is stronger in the RHA/Verh line relative to the RLA/Verh line. It is proposed that RLA/Verh rats may be used as a model with heuristic value for studying the role of 5-HTergic transmission in anxiety and in the anxiolytic effects of monoamine re-uptake inhibitors.",2003-Jul,Journal of neurochemistry,Journal Article,2003,YES,sa,Which neurochemical mechanism could explain the reduced anxiolytic response to monoamine re-uptake inhibitors in certain anxiety-prone individuals?,Reduced serotonin re-uptake site density and weaker cortical serotonergic tone.,"The abstract highlights that RLA/Verh rats, a model for heightened anxiety, exhibit lower [3H]-citalopram binding to serotonin re-uptake sites and less robust cortical serotonergic response to monoamine re-uptake inhibitors."

12745508,A history of depression and smoking cessation outcomes among women concerned about post-cessation weight gain.,"Because a history of depression has been hypothesized to affect cessation efforts and may be particularly problematic for women concerned about weight gain, we sought to document the prevalence of depression history among weight-concerned women smokers and evaluate its effect on treatment outcome. We also evaluated the impact of baseline depressive symptoms and cessation-related changes in symptoms. Women (N = 219) were classified as depression history positive (Major Depressive Disorder [MDD]) (MDD+) or negative (MDD-) according to responses on the Inventory to Diagnose Depression-Lifetime Version. All women received a group-based smoking cessation treatment. Women provided expired-air carbon monoxide samples, completed measures of depressive symptoms, and were weighed at pretreatment and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after quitting. Fifty-two per cent (n = 115) reported a lifetime history of major depressive disorder. Although MDD+ women were significantly more nicotine dependent, rates of continuous abstinence did not differ between MDD+ and MDD- women. However, MDD+ women were more likely to drop out of treatment prior to quitting. Additionally, depressive symptoms were associated with abstinence irrespective of depression history. Women who reported an increase in depressive symptoms from pre- to post-treatment were significantly less likely to be abstinent post-treatment, suggesting that depressive symptoms are more predictive of outcome than is previous disorder. Moreover, because of the prevalence of depression history among this subgroup of women smokers and its impact on early attrition, additional engagement and retention strategies may be useful.",2003-Feb,Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2003,YES,sa,How might a history of Major Depressive Disorder influence treatment dropout rates in a smoking cessation program for weight-concerned women?,Women with MDD history are more likely to drop out of treatment before quitting smoking.,"The abstract states that women with a history of MDD showed higher early attrition rates, suggesting a need for additional engagement and retention strategies in treatment."
14658930,"Brain circuits determine destiny in depression: a novel approach to the psychopharmacology of wakefulness, fatigue, and executive dysfunction in major depressive disorder.","Recent advances in neuropharmacology and neuroimaging are mapping the topography of symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD). Different malfunctioning neuronal circuits apparently mediate different symptoms in MDD. Since all patients with MDD do not have the same symptoms, this implies that they may not all have the same malfunctioning circuits. Furthermore, since MDD patients treated with antidepressants commonly experience residual symptoms that prevent them from attaining complete remission, this implies that not all circuits are successfully targeted by treatment in such patients. A new neurobiologically informed treatment strategy for such patients calls for targeting residual symptoms by augmenting antidepressants with agents capable of boosting specific neurotransmitters in the hypothetically malfunctioning circuits. With this approach, the frequently residual symptoms of sleepiness, fatigue, and executive dysfunction can be targeted with bupropion, atomoxetine, modafinil, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulants.",2003,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,2003,YES,sa,Which pharmacological agents can be considered to address residual symptoms of fatigue and executive dysfunction in patients with major depressive disorder who do not achieve full remission with standard antidepressants?,"Bupropion, atomoxetine, modafinil, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulants.","The abstract states that residual symptoms like fatigue and executive dysfunction in MDD can be targeted by augmenting antidepressants with agents boosting neurotransmitters in malfunctioning circuits, including bupropion, atomoxetine, modafinil, atypical antipsychotics, and stimulants."

17192116,Cost effectiveness of a pharmacy-based coaching programme to improve adherence to antidepressants.,"The efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of depression has been convincingly demonstrated in randomised trials. However, non-adherence to antidepressant treatment is common. To evaluate, from a societal perspective, the cost effectiveness of a pharmacy-based intervention to improve adherence to antidepressant therapy in adult patients receiving treatment in primary care. An economic evaluation was performed alongside a 6-month randomised controlled trial in The Netherlands. Patients who came to 19 pharmacies with a new prescription for a non-tricyclic antidepressant, i.e. those who had not received any prescription for an antidepressant in the past 6 months, were invited to participate. They were then randomly allocated to education and coaching by the pharmacist or to usual care. The coaching programme consisted of three contacts with the pharmacist, with a mean duration of between 13 and 20 minutes, and a take-home video reviewing important facts on depression and antidepressant treatment. The clinical outcome measures were adherence to antidepressant treatment measured using an electronic pill container (eDEM) and improvement in depressive symptoms measured using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL). Resource use was measured by means of questionnaires. The uncertainty around differences in costs and cost effectiveness between the treatment groups was evaluated using bootstrapping. Seventy patients were randomised to the intervention group and 81 to the usual care group; of these, 40 in the intervention group and 48 in the control group completed all of the follow-up questionnaires. There were no significant differences in adherence, improvements in the SCL depression mean item score and costs over 6 months between the two treatment groups. Mean total costs (2002 values) were 3275 euros in the intervention group and 2961 euros in the control group (mean difference 315 euros; 95% CI -1922, 2416). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the pharmacist intervention was 149 euros per 1% improvement in adherence and 2550 euros per point improvement in the SCL depression mean item score. Cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves indicated that the pharmacist intervention was not likely to be cost effective compared with usual care. In patients starting treatment with antidepressants, there were no significant differences in adherence, severity of depression, costs and cost effectiveness between patients receiving coaching by a pharmacist and patients receiving usual care after 6 months.

17276800,A depression screen and intervention for older ED patients.,"The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of screening examinations for depression on the care of older emergency department (ED) patients and to assess recognition of depression by emergency physicians (EPs). This was a prospective interventional study of 267 patients 70 years or older. Patients were screened for depression using the Short-Form Geriatric Depression Scale, and the results were presented to EPs after assessing EP recognition of depression. The prevalence of depression was 16.5% (44/267; 95% confidence interval, 12.0%-20.9%). Fifteen (34.1%) of 44 patients with depression were recognized by EPs as being depressed.

18177789,Cluster randomized trials produced similar results to individually randomized trials in a meta-analysis of enhanced care for depression.,"To examine whether cluster randomized trials (1) produce baseline imbalances between intervention and control conditions; (2) give results that are substantially different individually randomized trials; and (3) give different results when adjusted for unit of analysis error. We used 14 cluster randomized trials and 20 individualized trials of the same intervention (collaborative care for depression). We conducted a random effects meta-analysis to examine imbalance in baseline depression scores. We used meta-regression to test for differential effect size and heterogeneity between clustered and individualized studies. Unit of analysis error was corrected using a range of plausible published intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). There were no baseline imbalances in either cluster randomized (P=0.837) or individually randomized (P=0.737) studies. Cluster randomized studies gave almost identical estimates of effect size when compared to individually randomized studies (standardized mean difference, SMDcluster=0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17, 0.33; SMDindividual=0.24; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.36). Adjustment for clustering had minimal effect on clinical and statistical significance (pooled SMDICC 0.02=0.249 [95% CI: 0.174, 0.325] to SMDICC 0.05=0.258 [95% CI: 0.172, 0.345]).

As expected, after controlling for baseline anxiety, age, and gender, there was a significant interaction between pubertal status and challenge response in predicting the outcome variables. Specifically, adolescents reporting more advanced pubertal status and greater reactivity to the challenge evidenced greater levels of panic symptoms and somatic complaints, whereas pubertal status had relatively less of an effect on these variables among adolescents who did not respond as fearfully to the challenge.

18300649,Psychosocial effects of war experiences among displaced children in southern Darfur.,"This study focused on assessing the psychosocial effects of the long standing, high intensity, and guerrilla-style of warfare among displaced children in Southern Darfur. The goal was to better understand the etiology, prognosis, and treatment implications for traumatic reactions, depression, and grief symptoms in this population. Three hundred thirty-one children aged 6-17 from three IDP Camps were selected using a quota sampling approach and were administered a Demographic Questionnaire, Child Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index, Child Depression Inventory, and the Expanded Grief Inventory. Forty-three percent were girls and 57% were boys. The mean age of the children was 12 years. Results found that children were exposed to a very large number of war experiences with no significant differences between genders for types of exposure, including rape, but with older children (13-17 years) facing a larger number of exposures than younger children (6-12 years). Out of the 16 possible war experiences, the mean number was 8.94 (SD = 3.27). Seventy-five percent of the children met the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, and 38% exhibited clinical symptoms of depression. The percentage of children endorsing significant levels of grief symptoms was 20%. Increased exposure to war experiences led to higher levels of: (1) traumatic reactions; (2) depression; and (3) grief symptoms. Of the 16 war experiences, abduction, hiding to protect oneself, being raped, and being forced to kill or hurt family members were most predictive of traumatic reactions. Being raped, seeing others raped, the death of a parent/s, being forced to fight, and having to hide to protect oneself were the strongest predictors of depressive symptoms. War experiences such as abduction, death of one's parent/s, being forced to fight, and having to hide to protect oneself were the most associated with the child's experience of grief. In addition to Total Grief, Traumatic Grief, Existential Grief, and Continuing Bonds were measured in these children. Although trauma, depression, and grief often exist as co-morbid disorders, the mechanisms and pathways of these is less understood. In this study we used Structural Equation Modeling to better understand the complex interaction and trajectories of these three symptoms evolving from war exposure and loss. This study is the first of its kind to assess the psychosocial effects of war experiences among children currently living in war zone areas within Sudan. It identifies some of the most prevalent war-related atrocities and their varying impact on the children's psychological well-being and overall adjustment.

17876983,[Diagnosis and severity assessment of patients with depression].,"Clinically, depressive patients are increasing. It is very important but difficult to differentiate pathological depressive state from normal depressive reaction. In order to diagnose pathological depressive state (i.e. depression) and assess the severity, several diagnostic criteria and assessment scales for depression are available though most of them are provisional with limitations. In this review, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision(DSM-IV-TR), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) are introduced and discussed.

17171558,Behavioral evaluation of mice deficient in GABA(B(1)) receptor isoforms in tests of unconditioned anxiety.,"Emerging data support a role for GABA(B) receptors in anxiety. GABA(B) receptors are comprised of a heterodimeric complex of GABA(B1) and GABA(B2) receptor subunits. The predominant neuronal GABA(B1) receptor isoforms are GABA(B(1a)) and GABA(B(1b)). Recent findings indicate specific roles for these isoforms in conditioned fear responses, although their influence on behavior in tests of unconditioned anxiety is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the GABA(B(1)) isoforms in unconditioned anxiety. Mice deficient in the GABA(B(1a)) or GABA(B(1b)) receptor isoforms were examined in a battery of anxiety tests. In most tests, genotype did not significantly affect anxious behavior, including the elevated plus maze, marble burying, and stress-induced hypothermia tests. Corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were similarly unaffected by genotype. Female, but not male, GABA(-/-)B(1a) and GABA(-/-)B(1b) mice showed increased anxiety relative to wild-type controls in the elevated zero maze. In the staircase test, male GABA(-/-)B(1b) mice defecated more than male GABA(-/-)B(1a) mice, although no other test parameter was influenced by genotype. In the light-dark box, female GABA(-/-)B(1a) mice spent less time in the light compartment compared to the GABA(-/-)B(1b) females, whereas male GABA(-/-)B(1b) mice made fewer light-dark transitions than GABA(-/-)B(1a) males. Specific roles for either GABA(B(1)) isoform in unconditioned anxiety were not explicit. This differs from their contribution in conditioned anxiety and from the anxious phenotype of GABA(B1) and GABA(B2) subunit knockout mice. The findings suggest that the GABA(B(1)) isoforms have specific relevance for anxiety with a cognitive component, rather than for innate anxiety per se.",2007-Mar,Psychopharmacology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2007,YES,sa,How might sex differences influence the behavioral effects of GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b) receptor isoform deficiencies in unconditioned anxiety tests?,"Female GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b) knockout mice show increased anxiety in the elevated zero maze and light-dark box, while male knockout mice exhibit distinct behaviors like reduced light-dark transitions or increased defecation.","The abstract highlights sex-specific effects: females display heightened anxiety in certain tests, whereas males exhibit isoform-specific behavioral differences like reduced light-dark transitions or increased defecation in unconditioned anxiety tests."
17485646,Predictors of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease.,"To determine the occurrence of neuropsychiatric symptomatology and the relation to future development of Alzheimer disease (AD) in persons with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We followed 185 persons with no cognitive impairment and 47 with MCI (amnestic and multidomain), ages 75 to 95, from the population-based Kungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, for 3 years. Three types of neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed at baseline: mood-related depressive symptoms, motivation-related depressive symptoms, and anxiety-related symptomatology. AD at 3-year follow-up was diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-III-R criteria. Psychiatric symptoms occurred more frequently in persons with MCI (36.2% mood, 36.2% motivation, and 46.8% anxiety symptoms) than in cognitively intact elderly individuals (18.4% mood, 13.0% motivation, and 24.9% anxiety). Of persons with both MCI and anxiety symptoms, 83.3% developed AD over follow-up vs 6.1% of cognitively intact persons and 40.9% persons who had MCI without anxiety. Among persons with MCI, the 3-year risk of progressing to AD almost doubled with each anxiety symptom (relative risk [RR] = 1.8 [1.2 to 2.7] per symptom). Conversely, among cognitively intact subjects, only symptoms of depressive mood were related to AD development (RR = 1.9 [1.0 to 3.6] per symptom). The predictive validity of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for identifying future Alzheimer disease (AD) cases is improved in the presence of anxiety symptoms. Mood-related depressive symptoms (dysphoria, suicidal ideation, etc.) in preclinical AD might be related to the neuropathologic mechanism, as they appear preclinically in persons both with and without MCI.",2007-May-08,Neurology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2007,YES,sa,"In elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), how does the presence of anxiety symptoms affect their risk of progressing to Alzheimer disease (AD)?","Anxiety symptoms significantly increase the risk of AD progression, with each symptom nearly doubling the risk (RR = 1.8).","The abstract states that among individuals with MCI, the 3-year risk of AD progression almost doubles with each anxiety symptom, highlighting its predictive validity in this population."
18188835,Using decision theory to derive optimal cut-off scores of screening instruments: an illustration explicating costs and benefits of mental health screening.,"This paper shows how decision theory can be used to determine optimal cut-off scores on mental health screeners. The procedure uses (a) the costs and benefits of correct and erroneous decisions, and (b) the rates of correct and erroneous decisions as a function of the cut-off score. Using this information, for each cut-off point expected costs are calculated. The cut-off point with the lowest expected costs is the optimal cut-off score. An illustration is given in which the General Health Questionnaire is employed as a major depression screener. Optimal cut-off points are determined for four different contexts: patients, health service providers, society, and mental health researchers. As in these four situations different costs are encountered, different optimal cut-off points were found.",2007,International journal of methods in psychiatric research,Journal Article,2007,YES,sa,How can decision theory inform the selection of an optimal cut-off score for a depression screening tool in different clinical or societal contexts?,"By calculating expected costs for each cut-off score, considering decision-related costs/benefits and correct/erroneous decision rates, and selecting the score with the lowest expected costs.","The abstract explains that decision theory integrates costs/benefits of decisions and error rates to compute expected costs for various cut-off scores, which vary across contexts (e.g., patients, providers, society), leading to context-specific optimal cut-offs."
17433317,Anxiety and sexual stress in men and women undergoing infertility treatment.,"To better understand the specific nature of the relationship between anxiety and sexual infertility-related stress in men and women. Prospective study. University-affiliated teaching hospital. Consecutively referred patients referred for in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination (306 women, 295 men). None. Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Women reported greater anxiety and sexual infertility stress than men. However, men and women showed a similar pattern in the way anxiety symptoms were related to sexual infertility stress, with subjective anxiety and autonomic anxiety having the strongest relationship. Anxiety symptoms accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in sexual infertility stress for both sexes and predicted sexual stress to a considerable degree in men. Although this study found that there is more similarity than difference in how men and women experience anxiety and sexual infertility stress, the strong linkage between anxiety and sexual stress in men was surprising, because men tend to report less sexual stress and also less anxiety. Sexual stress among infertile men may be more closely tied to performance anxiety rather than to a more general deterioration in sexual satisfaction associated with infertility.",2007-Oct,Fertility and sterility,Journal Article,2007,YES,sa,What specific dimensions of anxiety are most strongly linked to sexual infertility-related stress in men and women?,Subjective anxiety and autonomic anxiety.,"The abstract indicates that subjective anxiety and autonomic anxiety have the strongest relationship with sexual infertility stress for both sexes, highlighting their significant role in predicting sexual stress, particularly in men."
17223200,The sales of antidepressants and suicide rates in Norway and its counties 1980-2004.,"Suicide is a major public health problem and depression is among the most important risk factors for suicide. Treatment of depression might prevent suicide. To study this hypothesis further we conducted an ecological study. An ecological study using sales data for antidepressants and numbers of suicides in Norway and Norwegian counties 1980-2004 was performed. Data on alcohol consumption and unemployment rates were registered and taken into account. Data were analyzed using Cochrane-Orcutt time series for the country as a whole. The county specific data were analyzed with a random coefficient model with county as subject and intercept and time (slope) as random variables using an unstructured covariance matrix. Sales of non-tricyclic antidepressants (non-TCAs) and suicide were clearly negatively related, even when controlling for alcohol and unemployment (adjusted r(2): 0.57). There was an effect modification between time and level of sales of non-TCAs. Studying the relationship between the sales of non-TCAs and the suicide rate, we found that it was significant and stronger for the low sales figures, but non-existent for the high sales figures. Ecological studies cannot infer causality. The fall in suicide rates in Norway and its counties was related to the increased sales of non-TCAs. The effect was mostly a result of a sales increase in the lower sales segment, indicating that a change from the more toxic TCAs, or heightened awareness of depression and its treatment, could explain the relationship found between sales of newer antidepressants and a decrease in suicide rate.",2007-Sep,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2007,YES,sa,"What might explain the observed stronger relationship between increased non-TCA antidepressant sales and decreased suicide rates at lower sales levels, compared to higher sales levels?",The shift from toxic TCAs to non-TCAs or heightened awareness of depression and its treatment.,"The abstract suggests the relationship was more pronounced at lower sales levels, possibly due to switching from TCAs to less toxic non-TCAs or improved awareness of depression treatment."

A prospective multicentred, intention-to-treat, cluster-randomised controlled trial. Eight implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation centres in the UK. Consecutive series of patients undergoing implantation with an ICD. The control group received usual care and advice from an experienced healthcare professional. The intervention group received usual care plus the ICD Plan. The plan was introduced before implantation, with three further brief telephone contacts with the nurse over the next 12 weeks. Health-related quality of life (Short Form Health Survey (SF-12)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), activity limitations (subscale from the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)), unplanned admissions and other economic data using a questionnaire developed for the study. 192 patients were recruited to the study (71 intervention, 121 control). At 6 months after surgery the intervention group had better physical health (37.83 vs 34.24; p<0.01), fewer limitations in physical activity (34.02 vs 31.72; p = 0.04), a greater reduction in the proportion of patients with a borderline diagnosis of anxiety (21% vs 13%; p = 0.60) and depression (13% vs 2%; p = 0.30), more planned ECGs (89% vs 66%; p = 0.04) and 50% fewer unplanned admissions (11% vs 22%; p<0.01).

17882232,The effect of acute tryptophan depletion on the neural correlates of emotional processing in healthy volunteers.,"The processing of affective material is known to be modulated by serotonin (5-HT), but few studies have used neurophysiological measures to characterize the effect of changes in 5-HT on neural responses to emotional stimuli. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effect of acute tryptophan depletion, which reduces central 5-HT synthesis, on neural responses to emotionally valenced verbal stimuli. Though no participants experienced significant mood change, emotional information processing was substantially modified following 5-HT depletion. A behavioral bias toward positive stimuli was attenuated following depletion, which was accompanied by increased hemodynamic responses during the processing of emotional words in several subcortical structures. Inter-individual differences in tryptophan depletion-elicited anxiety correlated positively with the caudate bias toward negative stimuli. These data suggest that 5-HT may play an important role in mediating automatic negative attentional biases in major depression, as well as resilience against negative distracting stimuli in never-depressed individuals.",2008-Jul,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2007,YES,sa,How might serotonin depletion influence attentional biases in individuals with major depressive disorder?,"Serotonin depletion may increase automatic negative attentional biases in major depressive disorder, potentially mediated by heightened caudate responses to negative stimuli.","The abstract states that serotonin depletion attenuates positive biases, increases neural responses to emotional words, and correlates caudate activity with negative biases, suggesting a role in depression-related attentional distortions."

17452055,"Social defeat, a paradigm of depression in rats that elicits 22-kHz vocalizations, preferentially activates the cholinergic signaling pathway in the periaqueductal gray.","Gene expression profiles in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of adult Long-Evans rats as a function of a stressful social defeat in inter-male fighting encounters were examined. This social subordination model mimics prototypical behavioral changes that parallel aspects of clinical depression, has been postulated to simulate early changes in the onset of depression in the losers, and has been successfully utilized for the evaluation of antidepressant activity. The 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have been shown to reflect negative emotional states akin to anxiety and depression. Social defeat is the most robust and reliable method of eliciting these calls. The PAG has been shown to be a key brain region for the generation of 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations, and 22-kHz USVs have been shown to be controlled by the mesolimbic cholinergic system. In this present study, we examined gene expression changes in the PAG of social subordinate rats compared to dominant rats that do not Exhibit 22-kHz USVs. We found that social defeat significantly altered the genes associated with cholinergic synaptic transmission in the PAG. The most robust of these were the increased expression of the beta2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (CHRNB2) and the T subunit of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) in the subordinate animals. These changes were corroborated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and found to be exclusive to the PAG compared to seven other brain regions examined.

In preclinical studies, vilazodone compared favorably to other antidepressants such as paroxetine and fluoxetine. Orally administered vilazodone inhibited ultrasonic vocalization in the rat after electrical foot shock (a model of anxiolytic activity). Yet, in the forced swimming test model of depression in rats, vilazodone administered intraperitoneally was active at 1 mg/kg but not at 3 or 10 mg/kg. During clinical trials, vilazodone completely abolished REM sleep for 8 h and demonstrated antidepressant efficacy that was equal to that of current antidepressant therapeutics. The author concludes that the success of vilazodone as an effective antidepressant agent will depend on whether the drug can produce a more rapid antidepressant effect than other SSRI agents, or if specific genetic markers of patients can be associated with clinical efficacy.",2007-Mar,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,Journal Article; Review,2007,YES,sa,What pharmacological properties of vilazodone differentiate it from standard SSRIs in the treatment of depression?,Vilazodone is both a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist.,"The abstract highlights that vilazodone combines SSRI activity with 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonism, which distinguishes it from standard SSRIs and may influence its efficacy and potential for rapid antidepressant effects."
17610910,Trazodone inhibits T-type calcium channels.,"Trazodone is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines for treating depression and insomnia. However, the pharmacological mechanism of action underlying trazodone's unique effects is unclear. Despite its nanomolar affinity for 5HT(2A) receptors, histamine(1) receptors and alpha(1) adrenoceptors the drug is given at high doses to achieve clinical efficacy suggesting that other target activities may also contribute to its effects. Here we report that trazodone inhibits recombinant T-type calcium channels (Ca(v)3.1, Ca(v)3.2 and Ca(v)3.3) in whole-cell patch-clamp studies at therapeutically relevant concentrations (IC(50)=43 microM, 45 microM, 23 microM, respectively). Inhibition was not use-dependent and showed only moderate voltage-dependence. Tonic block of Ca(v)3.1 channels held at negative membrane potentials suggested drug interaction with channels in the resting state. The major metabolite of trazodone, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, showed comparable potency on Ca(v)3.3 channels (IC(50)=35 microM) and was less active on Ca(v)3.1 channels (IC(50)=317 microM). We also demonstrate trazodone's inhibitory effects on native T-type calcium currents recorded from subthalamic neurons in a patch-clamp rat brain slice assay (approximately 30% inhibition at 100 microM).

18057803,Health problems and the use of health services among physicians: a review article with particular emphasis on Norwegian studies.,"This paper provides an overview of recent Norwegian and international research into physicians' health problems and their use of health services, with a particular focus on more recent studies relating to The Norwegian Physicians' Survey. The review suggests that physicians' physical health is similar to the general population, although female physicians tend to be in better health than other women. Some mental disorders such as depression and suicide appear to be more prevalent. Mental health problems are known to be associated with low work control (autonomy), time pressure and demanding patients. There is little difference between the genders early in their career, but more female than male physicians seem to experience problems later on. Physicians seldom take sick leave, and tend to make less use of primary health care and some screening facilities. Self-treatment is common -- even for mental problems.

18229570,Factors affecting health status in COPD patients with co-morbid anxiety or depression.,"Health status questionnaires provide standardized measures of patients' perceptions of the impact of disease on their daily life and well-being. Factors associated with health status were examined in a sample of 58 outpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and co-morbid anxiety and/or depression. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with the following measures: The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI); the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); and spirometry. Disease severity as measured with spirometrywas not related to health status. Perceptions of poor health as implied by the health status scores were positively associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression, sleep disturbances, and level of daily functioning. There were statistically significant differences between men and women on COPD severity, age, and the BAI scores. The findings emphasize the importance of screening the patients at all stages of disease severity for anxiety, depression, and sleeping problems, in order to provide adequate care for these problems.",2007,International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,2007,YES,sa,What factors should be assessed in patients with COPD to understand their health status beyond disease severity?,"Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and daily functioning.","The abstract identifies that health status in COPD patients is associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and daily functioning, rather than spirometry-based disease severity."
17314195,"Selective blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)7 receptors enhances 5-HT transmission, antidepressant-like behavior, and rapid eye movement sleep suppression induced by citalopram in rodents.","Evidence has accumulated supporting a role for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)7 receptors in circadian rhythms, sleep, and mood disorders, presumably as a consequence of the modulation of 5-HT-mediated neuronal activity. We hypothesized that a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, (2R)-1-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl]-2-[2-(4-methyl-1-piperidinyl)ethyl]-pyrrolidine (SB-269970), should increase activity of 5-HT neurons and potentiate the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram). In rats, administration of 3 mg/kg s.c. citalopram alone increased the extracellular concentration of 5-HT. This effect of citalopram on extracellular 5-HT concentration was significantly enhanced by an ineffective dose of SB-269970. Combining this dose of SB-269970 with a low dose of citalopram also resulted in a significant increase in extracellular concentration of 5-HT, suggesting a potentiation of neurochemical effects. In mice, citalopram and SB-269970 dose-dependently decreased immobility time in the tail suspension test. The dose-effect curve of citalopram was shifted leftward by coadministration of an effective dose of SB-269970. Furthermore, combining ineffective doses of citalopram and SB-269970 also resulted in a significant decrease of immobility time in the tail suspension test, suggesting potentiation of antidepressant-like effects. In rats, SB-269970 potentiated the increase of rapid eye movement (REM) latency and the REM sleep decrease induced by citalopram. SB-269970 also reversed the increase in sleep fragmentation induced by citalopram. Rat plasma and brain concentrations of citalopram were not affected by coadministration of SB-269970, arguing for a pharmacodynamic rather than a pharmacokinetic mechanism. Overall, these results indicate that selective blockade of 5-HT7 receptors may enhance the antidepressant efficacy of citalopram and may provide a novel therapy to alleviate sleep disturbances associated with depression.",2007-May,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,Journal Article,2007,YES,sa,How might combining a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) affect REM sleep patterns in patients with depression?,"It may increase REM latency, decrease REM sleep, and reduce sleep fragmentation.","The abstract notes that a 5-HT7 receptor antagonist potentiates the effects of citalopram, increasing REM latency, decreasing REM sleep, and reversing citalopram-induced sleep fragmentation, suggesting improved sleep architecture in depression treatment."

In the present study we investigated the effect of lithium addition on the 5-HT concentration in plasma and platelets and the concentration of 5-HIAA. Thirty-nine depressed inpatients who fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and who did not respond to monotherapy with either imipramine or fluvoxamine participated in this study. Concentration of 5-HT in both plasma and platelets did not change significantly during lithium addition. The 5-HT ratio (plasma concentration/platelet concentration) shows a small non-significant increase after 3 weeks lithium addition. The mean concentration of 5-HIAA shows a significant increase during lithium addition; with no difference between the imipramine and the fluvoxamine sample.

17049621,Genetic and environmental contributions to depressive personality disorder in a population-based sample of Norwegian twins.,"Depressive personality disorder (DPD) was introduced in DSM-IV as a new category requiring further study. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic and environmental contributions to DPD in a population-based twin sample, and include data on criteria performance, prevalence and diagnostic overlap. Axis I and Axis II diagnoses were obtained by structured interviews in a population-based sample of 2794 young adult twins. Statistical analyses included correlation and factor analysis based on polychoric correlation coefficients, and diagnostic overlap applying adjusted odds ratios. Contributions from additive genetic and common and unique environmental influences to the liability to DPD were computed using structural equation modelling, applying a multiple threshold variable. Liability to DPD could best be explained by additive genetic and unique environmental factors, with heritability estimates of 49% (95% CI 0.41-0.57) in females and 25% (95% CI 0.12-0.40) in males. The best-fitting model indicated that some of the genes contributing to DPD differ between men and women. Chronbach's alpha was 0.87. 2.0% of participants fulfilled the criteria for DPD, and overlap was most pronounced for dysthymic disorder and avoidant personality disorder. Low prevalence rates and subsequent inclusion of subthreshold criteria could have influenced parameter estimates, especially in males. DPD was almost twice as heritable in females as in males, comparable to previous studies on major depression. The proposed criteria showed good measurement properties, and DPD was not completely subsumed within any other disorder.",2007-Apr,Journal of affective disorders,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Twin Study",2007,YES,sa,"What is the estimated heritability of depressive personality disorder (DPD) in females, and how does it compare to males?","Heritability of DPD is 49% in females and 25% in males, with some genetic differences between sexes.","The abstract reports heritability estimates of 49% in females and 25% in males, and genetic contributions to DPD differ between sexes, indicating higher genetic influence in females."

High-CDI and low-CDI target children (n=86) were paired for videotaped game-playing with self-reported best friends. Researchers found that although high-CDI target children were not distinguishable from low-CDI peers in their displays of positive and negative emotion. However, the partners of high-CDI target children displayed significantly more negative emotion during the competitive task and significantly less positive emotion during the cooperative task than did partners of low-CDI target children. In addition, high-CDI target children and their partners reported less enjoyment of their interactions than low-CDI target children and their partners. This combination of findings suggests that depressive symptoms were associated with a relative lack of success achieving an optimal friendship interaction even under highly favorable conditions.",2007-Jun,Journal of abnormal child psychology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2007,YES,sa,How might depressive symptoms in children influence the emotional responses of their best friends during cooperative and competitive tasks?,Friends of depressed children show more negative emotions in competitive tasks and less positive emotions in cooperative tasks.,The abstract indicates that partners of high-CDI children displayed significantly more negative emotion in competitive tasks and less positive emotion in cooperative tasks than partners of low-CDI children.
17320784,Urban neighborhood poverty and the incidence of depression in a population-based cohort study.,"It has long been suggested that certain characteristics of the urban environment may influence population mental health. However, evidence from multilevel research addressing the relation between intraurban environments and depression has been conflicting, and prospective evidence in this regard has been limited. We assessed the relation between urban neighborhood poverty and incident depression in a population-based prospective cohort study. Using random-digit-dial telephone surveys, we recruited 1570 adult residents of New York City (NYC) in 2002. All persons interviewed at baseline were contacted again for follow-up 6 and 18 months after the initial interview. Eighty-one percent of the sample completed at least one follow-up visit. Analysis was restricted to 1120 persons who could be geocoded to NYC neighborhoods, which were represented by NYC community districts (N=59). Among persons with no history of major depression at baseline (N=820) there were 113 incident cases of major depression during the 18 months of follow-up; cumulative incidence of depression during the study period was 14.6 per hundred persons (95% confidence interval, 10.9-18.3). In low-socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods, the cumulative incidence of depression was 19.4 per hundred persons (95% confidence interval, 13.5-25.3), which was greater than that in high-SES neighborhoods (10.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.9-15.2). In multivariable models adjusting for individual covariates (sociodemographics, individual SES, social support, stressors, traumas, and history of post-traumatic stress disorder), the relative odds of incident depression was 2.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.59) for participants living in low-SES compared with high-SES neighborhoods.

Women completed depression scales at several time points and rated their infant's characteristics and childcare stress at 2- and 6-months postpartum. Mothers' reports of infant temperament were significantly different for depressed and non-depressed mothers, with depressed mothers reporting more difficult infants at both measurement points. These differences remained after controlling for histories of maternal abuse or prenatal anxiety, which occurred more often in the depressed mothers. There were no significant differences in childcare stress or perceived support between the groups. Infant temperament and childcare stress did not change over time.

18235867,Validity of the bereavement exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of major depressive episode.,"Since the publication of DSM-III in 1980, the official position of American psychiatry has been that the presence of bereavement is an exclusion criterion for the diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE). However, the empirical validity of this exclusion has not been well established. As DSM-V is now being planned, it is timely to reexamine the bereavement exclusion, particularly in the light of new evidence since the last reviews of this subject. This paper evaluates the relative validity of two competing hypotheses: 1) the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of MDE is not valid because, using validating criteria, bereavement related depression (BRD) within the first two months after the death of a loved one resembles non-bereavement related depression (SMD); 2) the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of MDD is valid because, using validating criteria, BRD within the first two months after the death of a loved one does not resemble SMD. The prevailing evidence more strongly supports Hypothesis 1 than Hypothesis 2. Thus, the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of MDE may no longer be justified.",2007-Jun,World psychiatry : official journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA),Journal Article,2007,YES,sa,What is the primary argument against maintaining the bereavement exclusion for the diagnosis of a major depressive episode (MDE)?,Bereavement-related depression (BRD) within the first two months after loss resembles non-bereavement-related depression (SMD) based on validating criteria.,"The abstract states that evidence supports the hypothesis that BRD and SMD are similar when evaluated using validating criteria, undermining the rationale for the bereavement exclusion in diagnosing MDE."

17455104,Mirtazapine monotherapy versus combination therapy with mirtazapine and aripiprazole in depressed patients without psychotic features: a 4-week open-label parallel-group study.,"There is preliminary evidence that the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole, which is a partial agonist at D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and a potent antagonist at 5-HT(2A) receptors, may be useful as an augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant depression. In this 4-week open-label non-randomized parallel-group study, the safety and efficacy of aripiprazole as add-on treatment strategy in patients suffering from non-delusional depression was investigated. Forty drug-free depressed inpatients without psychotic symptoms (13 men, 27 women), suffering from a major depressive episode or bipolar disorder, depressive state (DSM-IV criteria), were included in the study. The patients were treated either with mirtazapine monotherapy (45 mg/day) or combination therapy (mirtazapine 45 mg/day plus aripiprazole 15 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Safety and efficacy were assessed weekly using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Simpson-Angus Scale and the Barnes Akathisia Scale. Mirtazapine monotherapy and combined treatment with mirtazapine and aripiprazole showed comparable antidepressant effects as assessed at the endpoint of the study period. However, additional administration of aripiprazole accelerated the onset of antidepressant action in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression. Additive use of aripiprazole reduced the mirtazapine-induced increase in the body mass index. Moreover, mirtazapine had favourable effects on aripiprazole-induced akathisia. No other extrapyramidal side effects were seen in the combination therapy group. Combined therapy with mirtazapine and aripiprazole is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option which may be useful especially in treatment-resistant depression.

17994347,Depression in medical school: the influence of morningness-eveningness.,"Medical students are at higher risk for depression, affecting not only their lives but also patient care. This article studied a population of medical students engaged in lecture-based learning regarding the presence of depressive symptoms and its relation to morningness-eveningness. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depressive Inventory scale (BDI>10), and diurnal preference was assessed by the Horne & Ostberg Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Family history of depression and involvement in regular physical activity were also investigated. A total of 161 students, 77 (47.8%) males, aged 19 to 30 yrs (22.1+/-2.1) living in a city close to the equator were evaluated. Fifty-three individuals (32.9%) had depressive symptoms. Depressive individuals showed a trend to be female (p=0.07). Also, female gender showed a non-significant shift toward morningness. Fifty-eight (36.0%) subjects participated in regular physical activity. In 57 cases (35.4%), there was a history of depression in the family. Fifteen individuals (9.3%) were definitely evening type, 42 (26.1%) were moderately evening type, 44 (27.3%) were indifferent, 42 (26.1%) were moderately morning type, and 18 (11.2%) were definitely morning type. Family history of depression (OR=0.29, 95% CI=1.37-6.12) and sedentary life (OR=0.28, 95% CI=0.12-0.65) were associated with depressive symptoms.

17335316,Persisting low use of antipsychotics in the treatment of major depressive disorder with psychotic features.,"Practice guidelines recommend the use of a combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic for the pharmacologic treatment of major depressive disorder with psychotic features (MD-Psy). We assessed the extent to which the pharmacotherapy received by patients with MD-Psy under usual care conforms to these recommendations. We assessed the pharmacotherapy received under usual care conditions by 100 patients with MD-Psy prior to enrollment in STOP-PD (Study of the Pharmacotherapy of Psychotic Depression), a 12-week randomized, controlled trial comparing olanzapine plus sertraline to olanzapine plus placebo. Our assessment took place from January 2003 to May 2004. The strength of antidepressant trials was rated using the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF). The strength of antipsychotic trials or combinations of antidepressants and antipsychotics was rated using a modified version of the ATHF. We also determined whether the strength of antipsychotic or combination trials was associated with age, the duration of the current depressive episode, medical burden, cognitive status, or the severity of depressive or psychotic symptoms. Most patients with MD-Psy were treated with antidepressants (N = 82, 82%) or antipsychotics (N = 65, 65%). About half of the patients (N = 48, 48%) received therapeutic doses of an antidepressant; 10% (N = 10) received an intermediate dose of an antipsychotic, and 6% (N = 6) received a high dose. Overall, only 5% (N = 5) received a combination of an adequate dose of an antidepressant and a high dose of an antipsychotic. The strength of both antipsychotic trials (p = .021) and combination trials (p = .039) was significantly associated only with a longer duration of the current depressive episode.

17337318,"Internalized stigma, discrimination, and depression among men and women living with HIV/AIDS in Cape Town, South Africa.","AIDS stigmas interfere with HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and can become internalized by people living with HIV/AIDS. However, the effects of internalized AIDS stigmas have not been investigated in Africa, home to two-thirds of the more than 40 million people living with AIDS in the world. The current study examined the prevalence of discrimination experiences and internalized stigmas among 420 HIV-positive men and 643 HIV-positive women recruited from AIDS services in Cape Town, South Africa. The anonymous surveys found that 40% of persons with HIV/AIDS had experienced discrimination resulting from having HIV infection and one in five had lost a place to stay or a job because of their HIV status. More than one in three participants indicated feeling dirty, ashamed, or guilty because of their HIV status. A hierarchical regression model that included demographic characteristics, health and treatment status, social support, substance use, and internalized stigma significantly predicted cognitive-affective depression. Internalized stigma accounted for 4.8% of the variance in cognitive-affective depression scores over and above the other variables.

18045627,Withdrawal from chronic administration of cocaine decreases delta opioid receptor signaling and increases anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in the rat.,"Chronic administration of cocaine has been shown to attenuate the functional capacity of delta opioid receptors to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. Abuse and withdrawal from cocaine in humans is associated with increases in anxiety and depression. Since recent research supports the role of delta opioid receptors in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rodents, we hypothesized that functional desensitization of delta opioid receptors contributes to anxiety- and depression-like behavioral phenotypes following short-term withdrawal from chronic administration of cocaine. To test this hypothesis, delta opioid receptor signaling and behaviors were evaluated 24h after 14days of binge-pattern cocaine administration (15mg/kg three times daily at 1h intervals) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Results showed that the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by delta opioid receptor agonists was attenuated in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen 24h after cessation of cocaine administration. One day withdrawal from chronic administration of cocaine resulted in increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as measured by the elevated plus maze and the forced swim test respectively, and no change in locomotor activity. The anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were dose-dependently reduced by acute administration of the selective delta opioid receptor agonist, SNC80. These results demonstrate that early withdrawal from cocaine resulted in increased anxiety and depression, which accompanies the desensitization of delta opioid receptor function. Furthermore, cocaine-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors were reversible by the delta opioid receptor agonist SNC80.",2008-Feb,Neuropharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2007,YES,sa,"Which receptor dysfunction is implicated in anxiety and depression-like behaviors during early withdrawal from chronic cocaine use, and what pharmacological intervention may alleviate these symptoms?",Delta opioid receptor dysfunction; selective delta opioid receptor agonist SNC80.,"The abstract links delta opioid receptor desensitization to anxiety and depression-like behaviors after cocaine withdrawal, which were reversed by SNC80 administration."

23480302,Commensal microbiota modulate murine behaviors in a strictly contamination-free environment confirmed by culture-based methods.,"There is increasing evidence suggesting the existence of an interaction between commensal microbiota, the gut and the brain. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of commensal microbiota on the host behaviors in a contamination-free environment, which was verified by culture-based methods. Open-field and marble-burying tests were used to analyze anxiety-like behaviors and locomotor activity in gnotobiotic BALB/c mice with a common genetic background in a sterile isolator. The monoamine levels in several regions of the brain were measured in germfree (GF) mice and commensal fecal microbiota-associated mice (EX-GF). A 24-h exposure to the environment outside the sterile isolators rendered GF mice less anxious than those not contaminated, while there was no change in the locomotion. EX-GF mice, the gnotobiotic mice with normal specific pathogen-free microbiota, were less anxious and active than GF mice using open-field and marble-burying tests. The norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin turnover rates were higher in the EX-GF mice than in the GF mice in most regions of the brain, suggesting that monoaminergic neurotransmission might increase in the EX-GF mice comparing the GF mice. Monoassociation with Brautia coccoides reduced the anxiety level, but it did not affect the locomotor activity. In contrast, colonization with Bifidobacterium infantis decreased the locomotor activity, while having little effect on the anxiety level.

22571805,Heterogeneity of amygdala response in major depressive disorder: the impact of lifetime subthreshold mania.,"Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) present with highly heterogeneous symptom profiles. We aimed to examine whether individual differences in amygdala activity to emotionally salient stimuli were related to heterogeneity in lifetime levels of depressive and subthreshold manic symptoms among adults with MDD. We compared age- and gender-matched adults with MDD (n = 26) with healthy controls (HC, n = 28). While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed an implicit emotional faces task: they labeled a color flash superimposed upon initially neutral faces that dynamically morphed into one of four emotions (angry, fearful, sad, happy). Region of interest analyses examined group differences in amygdala activity. For conditions in which adults with MDD displayed abnormal amygdala activity versus HC, within-group analyses examined amygdala activity as a function of scores on a continuous measure of lifetime depression-related and mania-related pathology. Adults with MDD showed significantly greater right-sided amygdala activity to angry and happy conditions than HC (p < 0.05, corrected). Multiple regression analyses revealed that greater right-amygdala activity to the happy condition in adults with MDD was associated with higher levels of subthreshold manic symptoms experienced across the lifespan (p = 0.002). Among depressed adults with MDD, lifetime features of subthreshold mania were associated with abnormally elevated amygdala activity to emerging happy faces. These findings are a first step toward identifying biomarkers that reflect individual differences in neural mechanisms in MDD, and challenge conventional mood disorder diagnostic boundaries by suggesting that some adults with MDD are characterized by pathophysiological processes that overlap with bipolar disorder.",2013-Feb,Psychological medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2013,YES,sa,What neural activity pattern might suggest overlap between major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder in patients with subthreshold manic symptoms?,Elevated right-sided amygdala activity to happy faces.,"The abstract indicates that adults with MDD and lifetime subthreshold manic symptoms show abnormally elevated right-amygdala activity to happy faces, suggesting a pathophysiological overlap with bipolar disorder."

Patient-specific tractography-activation models (TAMs) are a new tool to help identify pathways modulated by DBS. TAMs consist of four basic components: 1) anatomical and diffusion-weighted imaging data acquired on the patient; 2) probabilistic tractography from the brain region surrounding the implanted DBS electrode; 3) finite element models of the electric field generated by the patient-specific DBS parameter settings; and 4) application of the DBS electric field to multi-compartment cable models of axons, with trajectories defined by the tractography, to predict action potential generation in specific pathways.

23689534,Antenatal prediction of postpartum depression with blood DNA methylation biomarkers.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) affects ∼10-18% of women in the general population and results in serious consequences to both the mother and offspring. We hypothesized that predisposition to PPD risk is due to an altered sensitivity to estrogen-mediated epigenetic changes that act in a cell autonomous manner detectable in the blood. We investigated estrogen-mediated epigenetic reprogramming events in the hippocampus and risk to PPD using a cross-species translational design. DNA methylation profiles were generated using methylation microarrays in a prospective sample of the blood from the antenatal period of pregnant mood disorder patients who would and would not develop depression postpartum. These profiles were cross-referenced with syntenic locations exhibiting hippocampal DNA methylation changes in the mouse responsive to long-term treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2). DNA methylation associated with PPD risk correlated significantly with E2-induced DNA methylation change, suggesting an enhanced sensitivity to estrogen-based DNA methylation reprogramming exists in those at risk for PPD. Using the combined mouse and human data, we identified two biomarker loci at the HP1BP3 and TTC9B genes that predicted PPD with an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve (area under the curve (AUC)) of 0.87 in antenatally euthymic women and 0.12 in a replication sample of antenatally depressed women. Incorporation of blood count data into the model accounted for the discrepancy and produced an AUC of 0.96 across both prepartum depressed and euthymic women. Pathway analyses demonstrated that DNA methylation patterns related to hippocampal synaptic plasticity may be of etiological importance to PPD.",2014-May,Molecular psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2013,YES,sa,How might altered sensitivity to estrogen-mediated epigenetic changes contribute to postpartum depression risk?,"It enhances susceptibility to estrogen-induced DNA methylation reprogramming, particularly in loci like HP1BP3 and TTC9B, affecting hippocampal synaptic plasticity.","The abstract links heightened estrogen sensitivity to DNA methylation changes in hippocampal regions, which correlate with PPD risk and synaptic plasticity pathways, suggesting a mechanistic connection."

One hundred five veterans (83% male, mean age=46 years, 30% minority) with one or more DSM-IV anxiety disorders began group treatment following randomization to adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or CBT. Both groups showed large and equivalent improvements on principal disorder severity thru 3-month follow up (ps<.001, d=-4.08 for adapted MBSR; d=-3.52 for CBT). CBT outperformed adapted MBSR on anxious arousal outcomes at follow up (p<.01, d=.49) whereas adapted MBSR reduced worry at a greater rate than CBT (p<.05, d=.64) and resulted in greater reduction of comorbid emotional disorders (p<.05, d=.49). The adapted MBSR group evidenced greater mood disorders and worry at Pre, however. Groups showed equivalent treatment credibility, therapist adherence and competency, and reliable improvement. CBT and adapted MBSR were both effective at reducing principal diagnosis severity and somewhat effective at reducing self-reported anxiety symptoms within a complex sample.

23882214,Zinc homeostasis and neurodegenerative disorders.,"Zinc is an essential trace element, whose importance to the function of the central nervous system (CNS) is increasingly being appreciated. Alterations in zinc dyshomeostasis has been suggested as a key factor in the development of several neuropsychiatric disorders. In the CNS, zinc occurs in two forms: the first being tightly bound to proteins and, secondly, the free, cytoplasmic, or extracellular form found in presynaptic vesicles. Under normal conditions, zinc released from the synaptic vesicles modulates both ionotropic and metabotropic post-synaptic receptors. While under clinical conditions such as traumatic brain injury, stroke or epilepsy, the excess influx of zinc into neurons has been found to result in neurotoxicity and damage to postsynaptic neurons. On the other hand, a growing body of evidence suggests that a deficiency, rather than an excess, of zinc leads to an increased risk for the development of neurological disorders. Indeed, zinc deficiency has been shown to affect neurogenesis and increase neuronal apoptosis, which can lead to learning and memory deficits. Altered zinc homeostasis is also suggested as a risk factor for depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), aging, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Under normal CNS physiology, homeostatic controls are put in place to avoid the accumulation of excess zinc or its deficiency. This cellular zinc homeostasis results from the actions of a coordinated regulation effected by different proteins involved in the uptake, excretion and intracellular storage/trafficking of zinc. These proteins include membranous transporters (ZnT and Zip) and metallothioneins (MT) which control intracellular zinc levels. Interestingly, alterations in ZnT and MT have been recently reported in both aging and AD. This paper provides an overview of both clinical and experimental evidence that implicates a dysfunction in zinc homeostasis in the pathophysiology of depression, AD, and aging.",2013,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,Journal Article,2013,YES,sa,"What role does zinc homeostasis play in the pathophysiology of clinical depression, and how might zinc deficiency contribute to its development?","Zinc deficiency disrupts neurogenesis, increases neuronal apoptosis, and contributes to learning and memory deficits, which are implicated in depression pathophysiology.","The abstract links zinc deficiency to impaired neurogenesis and increased neuronal apoptosis, both of which can negatively affect brain function and are risk factors for depression.

24094794,Mental imagery and post-event processing in anticipation of a speech performance among socially anxious individuals.,"The present study investigated whether post-event processing (PEP) involving mental imagery about a past speech is particularly detrimental for socially anxious individuals who are currently anticipating giving a speech. One hundred fourteen high and low socially anxious participants were told they would give a 5 min impromptu speech at the end of the experimental session. They were randomly assigned to one of three manipulation conditions: post-event processing about a past speech incorporating imagery (PEP-Imagery), semantic post-event processing about a past speech (PEP-Semantic), or a control condition, (n=19 per experimental group, per condition [high vs low socially anxious]). After the condition inductions, individuals' anxiety, their predictions of performance in the anticipated speech, and their interpretations of other ambiguous social events were measured. Consistent with predictions, high socially anxious individuals in the PEP-Imagery condition displayed greater anxiety than individuals in the other conditions immediately following the induction and before the anticipated speech task. They also interpreted ambiguous social scenarios in a more socially anxious manner than socially anxious individuals in the control condition. High socially anxious individuals made more negative predictions about their upcoming speech performance than low anxious participants in all conditions.

24307211,Testing gender invariance of the hospital anxiety and depression scale using the classical approach and Bayesian approach.,"Measurement invariance is an important attribute for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Most of the confirmatory factor analysis studies on the HADS adopt the classical maximum likelihood approach. The restrictive assumptions of exact-zero cross-loadings and residual correlations in the classical approach can lead to inadequate model fit and biased parameter estimates. The present study adopted both the classical approach and the alternative Bayesian approach to examine the measurement and structural invariance of the HADS across gender. A Chinese sample of 326 males and 427 females was used to examine the two-factor model of the HADS across gender. Configural and scalar invariance of the HADS were evaluated using the classical approach with the robust-weighted least-square estimator and the Bayesian approach with zero-mean, small-variance informative priors to cross-loadings and residual correlations. Acceptable and excellent model fits were found for the two-factor model under the classical and Bayesian approaches, respectively. The two-factor model displayed scalar invariance across gender using both approaches. In terms of structural invariance, females showed a significantly higher mean in the anxiety factor than males under both approaches. The HADS demonstrated measurement invariance across gender and appears to be a well-developed instrument for assessment of anxiety and depression.

23584609,Modeling panic disorder in rodents.,"Panic disorder (PD) is a subtype of anxiety disorder in which the core phenomenon is the spontaneous occurrence of panic attacks. Although studies with laboratory animals have been instrumental for the understanding of its neurobiology and treatment, few review articles have focused on the validity of the currently used animal models for studying this psychopathology. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is to discuss the strengths and limits of these models in terms of face, construct and predictive validity. Based on the hypothesis that panic attacks are related to defensive responses elicited by proximal threat, most animal models measure the escape responses induced by specific stimuli. Some apply electrical or chemical stimulation to brain regions proposed to modulate fear and panic responses, such as the dorsal periaqueductal grey or the medial hypothalamus. Other models focus on the behavioural consequences caused by the exposure of rodents to ultrasound or natural predators. Finally, the elevated T-maze associates a one-way escape response from an open arm with panic attacks. Despite some limitations, animal models are essential for a better understanding of the neurobiology and pharmacology of PD and for discovering more effective treatments.",2013-Oct,Cell and tissue research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",2013,YES,sa,Which brain regions are commonly targeted in animal models to study panic disorder and their role in modulating defensive responses?,The dorsal periaqueductal grey and the medial hypothalamus.,"The abstract states that these regions are stimulated electrically or chemically in animal models to elicit fear and panic responses, reflecting their role in modulating defensive behaviors related to proximal threat."

One potential factor is insomnia. Several repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies have reported on this symptom, however, they did not take into account the presence of hypersomnia or that insomnia was related to their outcome measure. Our aim was to investigate whether baseline sleep disruption was related to rTMS treatment response. We pooled data from four clinical trials using rTMS to treat depression, including 139 subjects in data analysis. Insomnia was measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HamD) sleep questions and hypersomnia from the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). To reduce the possible impact of insomnia on our treatment response outcome we created an adjusted HamD score which omitted sleep items. Sleep disturbances were common in our study: 66% had insomnia and 38% hypersomnia. Using regression analysis with our adjusted HamD score we found no relation between baseline insomnia or hypersomnia and rTMS treatment response.

Data on obstetric and perinatal complications, maternal IQ, presence of mood disorder in pregnancy and up to and including 18 months, and psychosocial status were also collected. Almost 90% of infants were exposed throughout the second and third trimesters to therapeutic antidepressant doses. Bivariate analysis showed no difference between exposed and unexposed infants in any of the neurodevelopmental outcomes.

The objective of the present study is to examine the correlations between anhedonia and impulsivity in three diagnostic groups: major depression, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. 121 outpatients (Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt) with major depressive disorder (N=29), schizophrenia (N=59), and schizoaffective disorder (N=33), were assessed and responded to the Beck Depression Inventory, Barrat's Impulsivity Scale-11, and Chapman's Social and Physical Anhedonia Scales. Physical and social anhedonia scores were negatively correlated to impulsivity scores in major depression patients. Conversely, higher scores in physical and social anhedonia predicted higher impulsivity scores in schizophrenia. No correlations between impulsivity and anhedonia were evidenced among schizoaffectives.

23211278,Quality of life in female patients with acromegaly.,"The aim of the study was to assess the quality of life and depression status in female patients with acromegaly. Fifty-seven female patients with acromegaly (21 inactive, 36 active) who were being followed-up at the Cerrahpasa Medical School, Endocrinology and Metabolism out-patient clinic, were included in the study. Depression status and quality of life of the patients were evaluated according to disease activity using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Acromegaly Quality of Life (AcroQoL) Questionnaire. Prolactin, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), total and free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-SO4), 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, free thyroxin (FT4), thyrotropin (TSH), cortisol, GH and IGF-I were studied in the groups. The AcroQoL total score in female patients with controlled acromegaly and uncontrolled acromegaly were 45.5 [Interquartile range (IQR)= 32.9-57.4], 47.7 [(IQR)= 38.6-63.3], respectively (p=0.53). There was no difference in BDI scores in acromegalic patients according to disease activity (p=0.41). In the correlation analysis, a strong negative correlation was found between AcroQoL total score and BDI score (r=-0.72, p<0.0001), OSAS (r=-0.32, p=0.01).

23516434,Psychosocial health problems associated with increased HIV risk behavior among men who have sex with men in Nepal: a cross-sectional survey.,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are marginalized, hidden, underserved and at high risk for HIV in Nepal. We examined the association between MSM sub-populations, psychosocial health problems and support, access to prevention and non-use of condoms. Between September-November of 2010, a cross-sectional survey on HIV-related risk behavior was performed across Nepal through snowball sampling facilitated by non-governmental organizations, recruiting 339 MSM, age 15 or older. The primary outcomes were: (a) non-use of condoms at least once in last three anal sex encounters with men and (b) non-use of condoms with women in the last encounter. The secondary outcome was participation in HIV prevention interventions in the past year. Among the 339 MSM interviewed, 78% did not use condoms at their last anal sex with another man, 35% did not use condoms in their last sex with a woman, 70% had experienced violence in the last 12 months, 61% were experiencing depression and 47% had thought of committing suicide. After adjustment for age, religion, marital status, and MSM subpopulations (bisexual, ta, meti, gay), non-use of condoms at last anal sex with a man was significantly associated with non-participation in HIV interventions, experience of physical and sexual violence, depression, repeated suicidal thoughts, small social support network and being dissatisfied with social support. Depression was marginally associated with non-use of condoms with women. The findings suggest that among MSM who reported non-use of condoms at last anal sex, the ta subgroup and those lacking family acceptance were the least likely to have participated in any preventive interventions. MSM in Nepal have a prevalence of psychosocial health problems in turn associated with high risk behavior for HIV.

This study examines the relationship of symptoms of depression with severity and control in a well-characterized cohort of asthmatics and healthy controls. Depressive symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. Disease control was measured by a composite index incorporating symptoms, activity limitation and rescue medication use. Individuals with asthma (n = 91) reported more symptoms of depression than controls (n = 36; p < 0.001). Those with severe asthma (n = 49) reported more symptoms of depression (p = 0.002) and poorer asthma control (p < 0.0001) than those with not severe asthma. Worse asthma control was associated with more depressive symptoms in severe (r = 0.46, p = 0.002) but not in not severe (r = 0.13, p = 0.40) asthmatics. The relationship of symptoms of depression among severe asthmatics was attenuated by disease control. Exploratory analyses identified specific disease symptom characteristics, as opposed to exacerbations, as associated with symptoms of depression. Among individuals with severe asthma, increased symptom burden is positively associated with risk for co-morbid depression.

Forty patients with CD and 40 healthy controls matched for demographic characteristics were included in the study. The subjects were evaluated with the Beck depression inventory (BDI), the health survey-short form (SF-36) and the multidimensional body-self relations questionnaire (MBSRQ). Subgroups of the patients with CD were formed on the basis of remission status and BDI scores. In this study, QoL in the general health category and body image were lower in the patients with CD than in the healthy subjects. However, no differences in depression scores were found between the two groups. When the CD group was evaluated according to remission rate, the mean BDI score was significantly higher in the CD patients without remission than in both the CD patients with remission and the healthy subjects (p = 0.04). However, the physical functioning, bodily pain and general health scores of the CD patients without remission on the SF-36 questionnaire were lower than in the CD patients in remission and the healthy subjects (p = 0.002, p = 0.04, p = 0.002, respectively).

Numerous physical and psychosocial problems that affect QOL are common in those undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation. Identifying which of these challenges are most closely associated with QOL would be helpful in developing priority targets for evidence-based interventions specific to those undergoing transplant evaluation. A total of 108 adults undergoing psychologic assessment for liver transplant completed clinical interview, neuropsychologic testing, and self-report inventories of depression, anxiety, cognitive appraisal characteristics, support resources, and QOL. Multiple regression analyses revealed that while emotional symptoms (anxiety and depression) were primarily associated with mental QOL, illness apprehension was the only variable uniquely associated with physical QOL after accounting for severity of liver disease, cognitive status, emotional symptoms, and support resources.

Research suggests that each issue separately is associated with depressive symptoms, but no studies have examined the combined effect of IPV, substance use and HIV on women's depression. Interviews were conducted with 96 women recruited from community health clinics serving low-income women in an urban U.S. city. All women were over 17, not pregnant, English-speaking, without private insurance and had experienced physical IPV in the past year. Women were primarily African American (82%) and 82% were receiving income assistance. Twenty seven percent were HIV-positive, and 27% had used heroin or cocaine in the past 6 months. Based on the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D ), 73% were depressed. Women who experienced severe IPV in the past 6 months were compared to women who experienced no IPV or psychological IPV only in the past 6 months; those who experienced severe IPV were 5.3 times more likely to be depressed, controlling for HIV status, drug use, age, and relationship status. Women who experienced severe IPV, were HIV-positive, and used drugs (7.3% of sample) were 7.98 times as likely to be depressed as women without these characteristics. These findings confirm that severe IPV is significantly associated with depression among urban abused women. Furthermore, this research suggests that the syndemic effect of IPV, substance use, and HIV could be even more detrimental to women's mental health.

23844175,Convergent and divergent functional connectivity patterns in schizophrenia and depression.,"Major depression and schizophrenia are two of the most serious psychiatric disorders and share similar behavioral symptoms. Whether these similar behavioral symptoms underlie any convergent psychiatric pathological mechanisms is not yet clear. To address this issue, this study sought to investigate the whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of major depression and schizophrenia by using multivariate pattern analysis. Thirty-two schizophrenic patients, 19 major depressive disorder patients and 38 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning. A support vector machine in conjunction with intrinsic discriminant analysis was used to solve the multi-classification problem, resulting in a correct classification rate of 80.9% via leave-one-out cross-validation. The depression and schizophrenia groups both showed altered functional connections associated with the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. However, the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and temporal poles were found to be affected differently by major depression and schizophrenia. Our preliminary study suggests that altered connections within or across the default mode network and the cerebellum may account for the common behavioral symptoms between major depression and schizophrenia.

One-hundred and twenty-seven patients (F/M: 94/33) with mean body mass index (BMI) ± standard deviation (s) =45.3±5.2 kg/m(2) and mean age 41.3±10.3 years participated in the study. Eighty-seven patients met for follow-up 1 year after surgery. Psychiatric disorders were assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) and the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-II). Levels of depression, anxiety and shame were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Internalized Shame Scale (ISS). Sixty-one patients (48%) at pre-operative assessment and 16 patients (18%) at 1-year follow-up had a comorbid psychiatric disorder.

22995737,Implementing practice guidelines for anxiety disorders in secondary mental health care: a case study.,"Recent years have seen the large-scale development of clinical practice guidelines for mental disorders in several countries. In the Netherlands, more than ten multidisciplinary guidelines for mental health care have been developed since 2003. The first dealt with the treatment of anxiety disorders. An important question was whether it is feasible to implement these guidelines because implementing practice guidelines is often difficult. Although several implementation interventions have proven effective, there seems to be no ready-made strategy that works in all circumstances. The Dutch multidisciplinary guidelines for anxiety disorders were implemented in a community mental health care centre, located in the east of the Netherlands. The centre provides secondary outpatient care. The unit within the centre that specializes in the treatment of anxiety disorders has 16 team members with diverse professional backgrounds. Important steps in the process of implementing the guidelines were analysing the care provided before start of the implementation to determine the goals for improvement, and analysing the context and target group for implementation. Based on these analyses, a tailor-made multifaceted implementation strategy was developed that combined the reorganization of the care process, the development of instruction materials, the organization of educational meetings and the use of continuous quality circles to improve adherence to guidelines. Significant improvements in adherence rates were made in the aspect of care that was targeted for change. An increase was found in the number of patients being provided with recommended forms of psychotherapeutic treatment, ranging from 43% to 54% (p < 0.01). The delivery of adequate pharmacological treatment was not explicitly targeted for change remained constant. The case study presented here shows that the implementation of practice guidelines for anxiety disorders in mental health care is feasible.

23146253,Gray matter volume in major depressive disorder: a meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies.,"We designed this study to perform a meta-analysis of gray matter (GM) findings in major depressive disorder (MDD) by using the signed differential mapping (SDM) toolbox. The Pubmed, ScienceDirect and Scopus databases were searched, and only studies published or published online before November 2010 have been included. Twenty voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of adult MDD patients were entered in the meta-analysis by SDM toolbox with threshold criteria set as error probability less than 0.00005 and cluster more than 50 voxels. Onset age, numbers of patients and controls, gender ratio of both groups, ratio of medicated patients, depression rating scores, illness duration, co-morbidity and existence of corrected p value were also meta-regressed as covariates to exclude confounding biases.

23178534,Effects of complete vagotomy and blockage of cell adhesion molecules on interferon-α induced behavioral changes in mice.,"Sickness behavior and chronic immune diseases are frequently associated with depressive symptomatology. In addition, immune activation by single cytokine therapies, such as treatment of malignancies and hepatitis C with interferon-alpha (IFN-α) often induces significant changes in emotional reactivity and affect. However, underlying pathogenic mechanisms of cytokine-induced brain dysfunction largely remain unknown. We presently demonstrate the induction of anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in male BALB/c mice after prolonged treatment with murine IFN-α for up to four weeks. Subsequently, neural and cellular communication routes between the immune system and the brain were examined. IFN-α induced anxious and depressive-like behavior in a light dark, open field, tail suspension, and novel object paradigm with a maximum effect after two weeks of treatment. Effect sizes of IFN-α varied between variables from 23 to 41%. Behavioral deficits were not prevented by complete vagotomy, or by blocking leukocyte function-associated-1 (LFA-1)/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and activated leukocyte cellular adhesion molecule (ALCAM)-mediated cellular adhesion events, which are both involved in immune cell entry to the brain. We demonstrate emergence of anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in a mouse model of sustained IFN-α application allowing investigation of its pathogenic mechanisms, which is of clinical importance. We failed to demonstrate a critical effect for the vagus nerve or adhesion molecules, but current experiments do not allow excluding the vagus nerve as an afferent communication route.

To assess the impact of parathyroidectomy on neuropsychological symptoms and biochemical parameters in people with asymptomatic pHPT, whilst controlling for the surgical procedure. PATIENTS/DESIGN/MEASUREMENTS: Twenty-four patients with asymptomatic pHPT requiring parathyroidectomy, in accordance with National Institutes for Health recommendations, were recruited prospectively. A control group of 23 subjects was recruited simultaneously from consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic hemithyroidectomy (HT) for benign thyroid nodules. Operations were performed by a single surgeon. Biochemical investigations and neuropsychological symptoms were measured preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. Neuropsychological symptoms were measured using the Hospital Anxiety (HAD-A) and Depression (HAD-D) scales and the Mood Rating Scale (MRS). Postoperatively, calcium and parathyroid hormone normalized in all patients in the pHPT group. Patients with pHPT showed a significant improvement in neuropsychological symptoms with a pre- and postoperative mean change of 2·45 ± 2·57 (P < 0·05) on HAD-A, 2·79 ± 3·85 (P < 0·05) on HAD-D, and 3·2 ± 4·57 (P < 0·05) on MRS, parameters that were unaltered in the HT group.

22122371,Psychiatric diagnosis in the elderly referred to a consultation-liaison psychiatry service in a general geriatric hospital in Japan.,"Because depression is a common disorder in later life, elderly patients with delirium can be misdiagnosed as having depression. This study aimed to compare psychiatric diagnoses in the elderly made by referring doctors and psychiatrists. Consecutive non-psychiatric inpatients aged 65 years or older that were referred to a consultation-liaison (C-L) psychiatry service of a general hospital in Japan were enrolled. An attending psychiatrist recorded the physical and psychiatric diagnoses of the referring doctors, reason for referral, psychotropic medication and sociodemographics. The psychiatrist recorded the psychiatric diagnosis after discussion with another psychiatrist in the C-L psychiatry service. A researcher categorized the diagnoses of the referring physicians and psychiatrists as F0 (organic brain syndrome), F1 (mainly alcoholism), F2/3 (mainly depression) and F4/5 (neurosis/insomnia) using The International Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). The degree of agreement between doctors' and psychiatrists' diagnoses was estimated for each F category using kappa statistics. Of the 192 referred inpatients, 172 were enrolled (79 [45.9%] men; mean age 81.6 ± 7.8 years).

Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is a cellular mechanism that allows for transcriptome diversity, yet there is limited knowledge in this respect with regard to Npy. Since the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex play an important role in affective disorders, we investigated alternative splicing of Npy in these regions of a rat model of depression (Flinders Sensitive Line, FSL) and its controls (Flinders Resistant Line, FRL). The existence of different Npy messenger RNA (mRNA) variants was examined using 5' and 3' RACE. In addition to the Npy mRNA species annotated in GenBank and Ensembl, we identified a novel ""short"" mRNA splice variant. Immunoblotting results argued against a putative translation of this ""short"" mRNA into protein in brain tissue. Compared to the FRL, the FSL had reduced ""short""Npy mRNA levels in the HIP (P=0.00014) and the PFC (P=0.016). Gene expression analyses in five brain regions of an outbred rat strain supported the presence of the ""short""Npy transcript in all examined regions and showed that it is expressed in ∼2.4-fold lower levels than the ""long""Npy mRNA.

Not only does this lower their quality of life but it also increases their risk of another stroke or death. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with PSD in order to better direct rehabilitation efforts aimed at cutting the incidence of PSD. This study was based on all patients admitted to the stroke unit of a hospital in southern Sweden from 1 October 2003 to 30 November 2005. The total number of patients involved was 181. Measures were collected at 2 ± 1 weeks after discharge from hospital, 3 ± 0.5 months after the occurrence of the stroke and 12 ± 1 months after the occurrence of the stroke. Information collected was results from the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Barthel Index together with demographic data including age, sex, time since stroke and relationship status. Those patients involved in the study were mainly men (58-59%) and generally those either married or cohabiting (53-57%). The age of respondents ranged from 32 to 92 years with a mean age of 74.0 (95%CI 72.37-75.63) at 2 ± 1 weeks after discharge.

In this study, we assessed the potential of radioiodinated (S,S)-IPBM as an imaging biomarker of NET to obtain diagnostic information about depression in relation to NET expression in the brain using a rat depression model. The ex vivo autoradiographic experiments using the (S,S)-[125I]IPBM showed significantly lower accumulation of radioactivity in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the anteroventricular thalamic nucleus (AVTN) of the depression group than in those of the control group. Consequently, in vitro autoradiographic experiments showed that NET maximum binding (Bmax) values in the LC and AVTN, known as NET-rich regions, were significantly decreased in the rat model of depression when compared to those of the control rats. In addition, there was an extremely good correlation between NET Bmax and (S,S)-IPBM accumulation (r  =  .98), an indication of radioiodinated IPBM as a quantitative NET imaging biomarker. The reduction in (S,S)-[125I]IPBM accumulation in the rat model of depression correlated with that of NET density. These results suggest that (S,S)-[123I]IPBM has potential as an imaging biomarker of NET to obtain diagnostic information about major depression.",2012,Molecular imaging,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2012,YES,sa,"What neuroanatomical regions demonstrate significantly reduced norepinephrine transporter (NET) density in a rat model of depression, and how might these findings inform biomarker development for major depression?",The locus coeruleus (LC) and anteroventricular thalamic nucleus (AVTN) show reduced NET density.,"The abstract identifies reduced NET density in the LC and AVTN of depressed rats, correlating with decreased radioligand accumulation.

22579802,Increased levels of conditioned fear and avoidance behavior coincide with changes in phosphorylation of the protein kinase B (AKT) within the amygdala in a mouse model of extremes in trait anxiety.,"Patients diagnosed for anxiety disorders often display faster acquisition and slower extinction of learned fear. To gain further insights into the mechanisms underlying these phenomenona, we studied conditioned fear in mice originating form a bi-directional selective breeding approach, which is based on elevated plus-maze behavior and results in CD1-derived high (HAB), normal (NAB), and low (LAB) anxiety-related behavior mice. HAB mice displayed pronounced cued-conditioned fear compared to NAB/CD1 and LAB mice that coincided with increased phosphorylation of the protein kinase B (AKT) in the basolateral amygdala 45 min after conditioning. No similar changes were observed after non-associative immediate shock presentations. Fear extinction of recent but not older fear memories was preserved. However, HAB mice were more prone to relapse of conditioned fear with the passage of time. HAB mice also displayed higher levels of contextual fear compared to NAB and LAB mice and exaggerated avoidance following step-down avoidance training. Interestingly, HAB mice showed lower and LAB mice higher levels of acoustic startle responses compared to NAB controls. The increase in arousal observed in LAB mice coincided with the general absence of conditioned freezing. Taken together, our results suggest that the genetic predisposition to high anxiety-related behavior may increase the risk of forming traumatic memories, phobic-like fear and avoidance behavior following aversive encounters, with a clear bias towards passive coping styles. In contrast, genetic predisposition to low anxiety-related and high risk-taking behavior seems to be associated with an increase in active coping styles.

This suggests that modulating AKT phosphorylation could reduce the formation of traumatic memories and improve therapeutic outcomes in anxiety disorders.
22006349,Understanding the latent structure of the emotional disorders in children and adolescents.,"Investigators are persistently aiming to clarify structural relationships among the emotional disorders in efforts to improve diagnostic classification. The high co-occurrence of anxiety and mood disorders, however, has led investigators to portray the current structure of anxiety and depression in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, APA 2000) as more descriptive than empirical. This study assesses various structural models in a clinical sample of youths with emotional disorders. Three a priori factor models were tested, and the model that provided the best fit to the data showed the dimensions of anxiety and mood disorders to be hierarchically organized within a single, higher-order factor. This supports the prevailing view that the co-occurrence of anxiety and mood disorders in children is in part due to a common vulnerability (e.g., negative affectivity). Depression and generalized anxiety loaded more highly onto the higher-order factor than the other disorders, a possible explanation for the particularly high rates of comorbidity between the two.

23023681,Interactive associations of depression and sleep apnea with adverse clinical outcomes after acute myocardial infarction.,"Depression and sleep apnea (SA) are common among patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and both are associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that there is an interaction between them in relation to post-AMI prognosis. Participants were patients with a recent AMI, 337 of them were depressed and 379 were nondepressed, who participated in a substudy of the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial. SA was identified from Holter electrocardiogram by an algorithm that detects cyclic variation of heart rate. During a median follow-up of 25 months, 83 (11.6%) patients either died or experienced a recurrent AMI and 43 (6.0%) patients died. Among 94 patients with both depression and SA, these end points occurred in 25 (26.6%) and 20 (21.3%) at 3.9- and 6.9-times higher prevalence than predicted probabilities by ENRICHD clinical risk scores (p <.001 for both). In the patients with depression alone, SA alone, or neither, the prevalence was similar to the predicted probability. Depression and SA showed significant interactions in prediction of these end points (p = .02 and p = .03). SA independently predicted these end points in patients with depression (p = .001 and p <.001) but not in those without depression (p = .84 and p = .73). Similarly, depression independently predicted these end points in patients with SA (p <.001 for both) but not in those without SA (p = .12 and p = .61).

22648379,Decreased thalamo-cortical connectivity by alteration of neural information flow in theta oscillation in depression-model rats.,"Alterations in oscillatory brain activity are strongly correlated with cognitive performance in various physiological rhythms. The present study investigated whether the directionality of neural information flow (NIF) could be used to characterize the synaptic plasticity in thalamocortical (TC) pathway, and examined which frequency field oscillations were mostly related to the cognitive deficiency in depression. Two novel algorithms were employed to determine the coupling interaction between the LD thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in five frequency bands, using the phase signals of local field potentials (LFP) in these two regions. The results showed that the power of neural activity in mPFC was increased in delta, theta and beta frequency bands in depression. However, the nonlinear characteristics of LFP activity were weakened in depression by means of sample entropy measurements. In the analysis of phase dynamics, the phase synchronization values were reduced in theta rhythm in stressed rats. Importantly, the coupling direction index d and the unidirectional influence from LD thalamus to mPFC were significantly reduced at the theta rhythm in rats in depression, and increased after memantine treatment, which were associated with the LTP alterations and cognitive impairment in our previous report. Moreover, the fact that the reduced entropy value was only found in mPFC might implicate postsynaptic effect involved in synaptic plasticity alteration in the depression model. The results suggest that the effects of depression on cognitive deficits are mediated via profound alterations in information flow in the TC pathway, and the directional index at theta rhythm could be used as a measurement of synaptic plasticity.",2012-Dec,Journal of computational neuroscience,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2012,YES,sa,Which specific thalamocortical pathway alteration at the theta frequency band is associated with cognitive deficits in depression?,Reduced unidirectional neural information flow from the LD thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex.,The abstract highlights decreased directional index and unidirectional influence at theta rhythm in the LD thalamus-mPFC pathway as key mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in depression.

22537684,The use of hormonal contraceptive agents and mood disorders in women.,"Mood disorders are a major cause of disability in developed countries, and contraceptive agents among the most widely used medications. The relationship between contraceptive agents and mood is unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the association between current contraception use and mood disorders in a random population-based sample of women. This study examined epidemiological data obtained from 498 women aged 20-50year participating in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study (GOS). Mood disorders were diagnosed using a clinical interview (SCID-I/NP) and information on medication use and other lifestyle factors were documented. After adjusting for age and socioeconomic status (SES), women taking progestin-only contraceptive agents had an increased likelihood of a current mood disorder (OR 3.0 95%CI: 1.1-7.8, p=0.03).

22475132,Spanish version of the Geriatric Depression Scale: reliability and validity in persons with mild-moderate dementia.,"Depressive symptoms are prevalent among persons with dementia (PWD). Our aim was to assess the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15 and GDS-5) in PWD. In this cross-sectional study, five healthcare centers providing care for PWD from two cities in Spain participated. Ninety-six community-dwelling PWD aged 55 years and older, living with a known caregiver, completed a battery of scales including the GDS-15 and GDS-5, the Cornell Scale Depression in Dementia (CSDD), a list of self-reported chronic health conditions (yes/no), severity of dementia (Mini-Mental State Examination), functional status (Barthel Index), generic quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), and sociodemographic information. Cronbach's α coefficients were 0.81 and 0.72 for GDS-15 and GDS-5, respectively, providing evidence for acceptable internal consistency. Significant associations between the GDS-15/GDS-5, the Barthel Index, CSDD, and the WHOQOL-BREF were found. No significant differences were found on GDS-15/GDS-5 scores among dementia diagnostic groups (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, mixed dementia, other dementia) or between mild (MMSE 21-26) and moderate (MMSE 10-20) dementia. Participants self-reporting depression on the comorbid condition list (yes) scored significantly higher on the GDS-15 and GDS-5 compared to those who reported not having depression. Exploratory factor analyses suggested a two-factor structure on GDS-15 which accounted for 41.6% of the variability, while the one-factor structure on the GDS-5 accounted for 48.1% of the variability.

22990434,The absence of depressive symptoms is not the presence of wellness: validation of the Clinical Positive Affect Scale.,"Many patients with depression respond or remit with current treatments, but often experience persistent distress, in part because they perceive that they have not returned to their normal or premorbid state. Some continue to have a lack of subjective psychological well-being and positive affect following treatment. It would be useful to measure these deficits and explore whether interventions can improve them. Currently, no clinically useful scale has been developed to measure positive affect. To fill this gap, we developed the Clinical Positive Affect Scale (CPAS). The purpose of this study is to describe the development and validation of the CPAS, a 16-item self-report measurement of self-perceived affective and cognitive correlates of positive affect, in a sample of 300 college students. A principal component analysis with varimax rotation showed one major factor of positive affect, with all items revealing high loadings (≥ 0.65) on the single factor. The CPAS also demonstrated good internal consistency (α = 0.97) and strong part-whole correlations. Finally, the CPAS revealed some degree of divergent validity through moderately strong negative correlations with validated measures of depression, anxiety and drug abuse.

22750155,Impaired prefrontal-amygdala effective connectivity is responsible for the dysfunction of emotion process in major depressive disorder: a dynamic causal modeling study on MEG.,"Depression is proved to be associated with the dysfunction of prefrontal-limbic neural circuit, especially during emotion processing procedure. Related explorations have been undertaken from the aspects of abnormal activation and functional connectivity. However, the mechanism of the dysfunction of coordinated interactions remains unknown and is still a matter of debate. The present study gave direct evidence of this issue from the aspect of effective connectivity via dynamic causal modeling (DCM). 20 major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited to attend facial emotional stimulus during MEG recording. Bayesian model selection (BMS) was applied to choose the best model. Results under the optimal model showed that top-down endogenous effective connectivity from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to the amygdala was greatly impaired in patients relative to health controls; while bottom-up endogenous effective connectivity from the amygdala to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as well as modulatory effective connectivity from ACC to DLPFC was significantly increased. We inferred the incapable DLPFC failed to exert influence on amygdala, and finally lead to enhanced amygdala-ACC and ACC-DLPFC bottom-up effects.

22611088,The relationship of antidepressant prescribing concentration to treatment duration and cost.,"Widely accepted treatment guidelines and performance measures encourage patients to stay on antidepressant medication beyond the acute phase of treatment in order to achieve full remission and reduce risk of relapse. However, many patients discontinue antidepressant medication treatment prematurely for various reasons, including side-effects or nonresponse to the initial medication prescribed. Customization of medications to differing patient profiles could potentially improve medication treatment duration, but for many diseases physicians tend to concentrate on a limited subset of available medications. Little is known about the effects of concentration in prescribing on medication treatment duration and expenditures. To determine the extent to which prescribing for treatment of depression is concentrated, using data from a privately insured population. To evaluate the relationship between prescribing concentration and subsequent duration of medication treatment, expenditure on medications, and the number of distinct medications used. Individuals receiving antidepressant treatment paid for by a large private managed behavioral health organization, in the US. The study uses psychotropic pharmacy claims data for 2003-06 for plan members who received a depression diagnosis and had an antidepressant claim. The resulting sample includes 9,017 patients seen by 543 prescribers. For each prescriber, we compute prescribing concentration, using the Herfindahl index and the share for the three most-used medications. Treatment expenditure is computed as the sum of payments by plan and by patients. Regression analysis is used to identify the association of prescribing concentration with medication treatment duration, expenditures and other utilization measures. For these physicians, the mean share of the physician's total antidepressant prescribing accounted for by their three most-used regimens was 72%. The mean value of the Herfindahl index was 0.27. Over the 180-day follow-up period, the average patient had 103 days covered by antidepressant prescriptions, resulting in mean expenditures of $286, or $2.25 per day of medication supplied. Regression analysis indicates that higher concentration in a physician's prescribing was associated with fewer days of antidepressant coverage, lower medication expenditures, and subsequent use of fewer distinct medications. Higher concentration in prescribing is associated with shorter observed duration of medication treatment and lower expenditures on medications. The lower expenditures appear to be due to earlier discontinuation and fewer different medications, not to a lower cost per day supplied. Limitations of this study include lack of data on medical visits or on reasons for medication discontinuation, as the study is based on pharmacy claims data, not medical claims or surveys. In addition, it is not known whether the patient's antidepressant use represents a new episode. Finally, lack of randomization implies that the associations identified may not be causal. Concentration of physicians on certain medications may run counter to the increasing calls for customization of medication selection. Insurer policies which limit physicians' choice of medications may be lowering expenditures in part by reducing patients' medication treatment duration. Additional studies are needed to understand what mechanisms may link concentration in prescribing to medication treatment duration and expenditures.",2012-Mar,The journal of mental health policy and economics,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2012,YES,sa,How might a physician's high concentration in prescribing specific antidepressants impact treatment duration and medication expenditures for patients with depression?,High prescribing concentration is associated with shorter treatment duration and lower medication expenditures.,"The abstract indicates that higher prescribing concentration correlates with fewer days of antidepressant coverage and lower expenditures, primarily due to earlier discontinuation and fewer distinct medications prescribed, not reduced daily medication costs."

22697444,An integrated approach to delivering exposure-based treatment for symptoms of PTSD and depression in OIF/OEF veterans: preliminary findings.,"Combat-exposed military personnel from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan report high rates of PTSD and associated psychiatric problems. A formidable body of research supports exposure therapy as a front-line intervention for PTSD; however, relative to studies of civilians, fewer investigations have evaluated the effectiveness of exposure therapy using military samples. Specifically, barriers to care (e.g., stigma associated with receiving mental health services ) may compromise utilization of evidence-based psychotherapy. As such, researchers have argued that veterans with PTSD may require an integrated and innovative approach to the delivery of exposure techniques. This paper presents the rationale for and preliminary data from an ongoing clinical trial that compares the home-based telehealth (HBT) application of a brief, behavioral treatment (Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure; BA-TE) for veterans with PTSD to the standard, in-person application of the same treatment. Forty OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD and MDD were consented, enrolled, and randomized to condition (BA-TE in-person, or BA-TE HBT) and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed at pre- and posttreatment.

This study assessed the association between improvements in depression/anxiety and self-reported adherence to health behaviors in depressed cardiac patients in the 6 months after cardiac hospitalization. Data were analyzed from depressed patients on inpatient cardiac units who were hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or arrhythmia and enrolled in a randomized trial of collaborative care depression management (n = 134 in primary analysis). Measurements of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Anxiety subscale), and adherence to secondary prevention behaviors (Medical Outcomes Study-Specific Adherence Scale items) were obtained at baseline, 6 weeks 12 weeks, and 6 months.

22784486,Effects of ketamine in treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"Treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually lead to incomplete symptom relief and take a long-time to reach full effect. Convergent evidence suggests that glutamate abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of OCD. Ketamine is a potent noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor. Trials have reported rapid antidepressant effects after low-dose ketamine infusion. We conducted an open-label trial of ketamine (.5 mg/kg IV over 40 min) in 10 subjects with treatment-refractory OCD. Response was defined as >35% improvement in OCD symptoms and >50% improvement in depression symptoms from baseline at any time between 1 and 3 days after infusion. None of 10 subjects experienced a response in OCD symptoms in the first 3 days after ketamine. Four of seven patients with comorbid depression experienced an antidepressant response to ketamine in the first 3 days after infusion. Both OCD and depression symptoms demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the first 3 days after infusion compared with baseline, but the OCD response was <12%. The percentage reduction in depressive symptoms in the first 3 days after ketamine infusion was significantly greater than the reduction in OCD symptoms. Ketamine effects on OCD symptoms, in contrast to depressive symptoms, did not seem to persist or progress after the acute effects of ketamine had dissipated.",2012-Dec-01,Biological psychiatry,Journal Article,2012,YES,sa,What is a key difference in the early therapeutic effects of low-dose ketamine on treatment-refractory OCD symptoms compared to comorbid depressive symptoms?,"Ketamine showed rapid and significant antidepressant effects in some patients with comorbid depression, but its effect on OCD symptoms was minimal (<12%) and non-persistent.","The abstract highlights that ketamine led to significant depressive symptom reduction in some patients, whereas OCD symptom improvement was minor, transient, and did not progress after acute effects dissipated."
21702709,Depression and body composition among older adults.,"Recent investigations have reported an association between depression and geriatric syndromes associated with low body mass, including frailty and osteoporosis. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between depression and body composition among older adults. Data were from a case-cohort study (n = 98) of adults aged 60 and older nested within the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study. Lifetime depression syndrome was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). Body composition (total and central lean and fat mass) was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The association between depression and body composition was evaluated using linear regression with bootstrap standard errors. Overall, there was no association between depression and total fat or total lean body mass. Among women, depression was associated with reduced central fat (B = -3.6 kg, p < 0.06) and lean (B = -3.3 kg, p < 0.04) mass adjusting for age, race, smoking status, and physical activity. Depression was unrelated to total or central fat or lean mass among men. Depression is associated with significantly lower central fat and lean mass among older women.

The premise is that individuals who are prone to anxiety show an altered interoceptive prediction signal, i.e., manifest augmented detection of the difference between the observed and expected body state. As a consequence, the increased prediction signal of a prospective aversive body state triggers an increase in anxious affect, worrisome thoughts and other avoidance behaviors.

Further testing of this model--which should include investigation of genetic and environmental influences--may lead to the development of novel treatments that attenuate this altered interoceptive prediction signal in patients with anxiety disorders.",2006-Aug-15,Biological psychiatry,Journal Article; Review,2006,YES,sa,"What neuroanatomical structure is implicated in the altered interoceptive prediction signal thought to drive anxiety symptoms, and what role does it play?","The anterior insula; it mediates the augmented detection of differences between expected and observed body states, triggering anxious affect and avoidance behaviors.","The abstract identifies the anterior insula as key in processing an altered interoceptive prediction signal, which enhances the perception of aversive body states and contributes to anxiety symptoms."
16919786,Role of the endocannabinoid system in depression and suicide.,"Depression is one of the most prevalent forms of neuropsychiatric disorder and is a major cause of suicide worldwide. The prefrontal cortex is a crucial brain region that is thought to be involved in the regulation of mood, aggression and/or impulsivity and decision making, which are altered in suicidality. Evidence of the role of the endocannabinoid (EC) system in the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is beginning to emerge. The behavioral effects of ECs are believed to be mediated through the central cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Alterations in the levels of ECs, and in the density and coupling efficacy of CB1 receptors, have been reported in the prefrontal cortex of depressed and alcoholic suicide victims. These findings support our hypothesis that altered EC function contributes to the pathophysiological aspects of suicidal behavior.

Using structured clinical assessments, the authors studied a group of adult males and females presenting to an outpatient depression clinic, to examine the childhood risk factors and the distinguishing comorbid features associated with those reporting exposure to bullying. Just over a quarter of both men and women reported having experienced bullying that was severe and traumatic. More of these subjects also reported several other well studied childhood risk factors. Childhood correlates that were particularly relevant for exposure to bullying were parental overcontrol, illness or disability, and the tendency to have an inhibited temperament early in life. The experience of childhood bullying was strongly related to high levels of comorbid anxiety, both in terms of greater levels of state anxiety and a higher prevalence of both social phobia and agoraphobia. Independent of other childhood risk factors, exposure to bullying was especially predictive of subjects' higher levels of general state anxiety and the tendency to express anxious arousal externally when under stress. These results are compatible with both cross-sectional and prospective studies of child and adolescent samples, and highlight the potential etiological significance of early peer victimization experiences for a percentage of adults suffering from depression with comorbid anxiety.",2006-Mar,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2006,YES,sa,Which childhood factors are particularly predictive of comorbid anxiety in adults with depression?,"Exposure to bullying, parental overcontrol, illness/disability, and inhibited temperament.","The abstract highlights these childhood factors as strongly associated with comorbid anxiety, especially bullying, which predicts higher state anxiety and external anxious arousal under stress."

In this article we suggest that pharmacotherapy aimed not at treating the symptoms of anxiety but instead aimed at improving the learning that takes place in exposure therapy might actually improve the effectiveness of exposure therapy. This idea was based on animal work showing that the partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) facilitated extinction of fear when given either before or shortly after exposure to fearful cues, reduced return of fear that is normally seen when extinction training is followed by stress, and led to generalized extinction, where DCS given in combination with exposure to one fearful cue led to extinction to another cue previously paired with the same aversive event.

In addition to genetic heritability, a range of family factors may also be involved in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety. Evidence for a relationship between family factors and childhood as well as parental anxiety is reviewed.

The reviewed literature provides evidence for an association between each of these family factors and child anxiety. However, there is little evidence as yet that identified family factors are specific to child anxiety, rather than to child psychopathology in general. Moreover, evidence for a relationship between child anxiety and family factors is predominantly cross-sectional. Therefore, whether the identified family factors cause childhood anxiety still needs to be investigated.

We identified four main strategies used by GPs in the pharmacological management of depressive patients: marketing additional beneficial drug effects, addressing the patients as experts, somatic attribution of the disease and referral to a specialist. To support their prescription, GPs use a variety of strategies to motivate both patients to take a certain drug and themselves to deal with difficult patients or situations in their management of depression.",2006-Feb,Family practice,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2006,YES,sa,What are two strategies a general practitioner might use to address patient resistance to initiating antidepressant medication?,Marketing additional beneficial drug effects and addressing the patient as an expert.,"The abstract identifies that GPs motivate patients to take antidepressants by highlighting additional drug benefits and involving patients as experts in their own care, particularly in challenging situations."

16619141,Predictors of attributional style change in children.,"A number of studies have supported the hypothesis that negative attributional styles may confer vulnerability to the development of depression. The goal of this study was to explore factors that may contribute to the development of negative attributional styles in children. As hypothesized, elevated levels of depressive symptoms and hopelessness at the initial assessment predicted negative changes in children's attributional styles over the 6-month follow-up period. In addition, elevated levels of verbal victimization occurring between the 2 assessments, as well as that occurring in the 6 months preceding the initial assessment, prospectively predicted negative changes in children's attributional styles over the follow-up. Further, initial depressive symptoms and verbal victimization during the follow-up continued to significantly predict attributional style change even when the overlap among the predictors was statistically controlled. Contrary to the hypotheses, however, neither parent-reported levels of overall negative life events nor parents' attributions for their children's events predicted changes in children's attributional styles.",2006-Jun,Journal of abnormal child psychology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2006,YES,sa,What factors have been shown to prospectively predict negative changes in children's attributional styles over time?,"Elevated depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and verbal victimization predict negative changes in children's attributional styles.","The abstract identifies depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and verbal victimization as predictors of negative attributional style changes, even when controlling for overlapping predictors.

16188362,"Couples' experiences of postnatal depression: a framing analysis of cultural identity, gender and communication.","Difficulties in communication have been associated with fathers' perceived lack of support for mothers suffering postnatal depression (PND). This paper investigates why the communication of the experience of PND is so difficult and considers how these difficulties might be linked, in part, to the diagnostic process. The study explores, through in-depth interviews, how six Australian couples talked about the new mothers' experience of mild to moderate PND. Framing analysis revealed discrepancies in the couples' explanations of the mothers' PND. The application of the concept of 'framing' has come to the study of mental health by way of Goffman's work on how experience becomes organised. Goffman used the technique of 'frame analysis' to identify and describe the taken-for-granted sociocultural elements that give meaning to a situation. This study identified that mothers and fathers used different frames, with mothers understanding their postnatal experience primarily from within an 'identity' frame and fathers understanding the mothers' experience primarily through a 'psychological' or 'physical hardship' frame.

16651508,Major depressive episodes and random mood.,"Mathematical models describing changes in mood in affective disorders may assist in the identification of underlying pathologic and neurobiologic mechanisms and in differentiating between alternative interpretations of psychiatric data. Using time-to-event data from a large epidemiologic survey on recovery from major depression, to model the survival probability, in terms of an underlying process, with parameters which might be recognized and influenced in clinical practice. We present a sequential-phase model for survival analysis, which describes depression as a state with or without an additional incubation phase. Recovery is seen as the transition to a nondepressive state. We show that this sequential-phase model finds a microscopic realization in a dynamic description, the random-mood model, which depicts mood as governed by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type of stochastic process, driven by intermittent gaussian noise. For reversible depression (80%), the fractional probability of recovery is remarkably independent of the history of the depression. Analysis with the sequential-phase model suggests single exponential decay in this group, possibly with a short incubation phase. Within the random-mood model, the data for this reversibly depressed cohort are compatible with an intermittent noise pattern of stimuli with average spacing of 4 months and incompatible with nonintermittent noise. Time-to-event data from psychiatric epidemiologic studies can be conceptualized through modeling as intrasubject processes. The proposed random-mood model reproduces the time-to-event data and explains the incubation phase as an artifact due to the inclusion criterion of 14 days in most current psychiatric diagnostic systems. Depression is found to result more often from pileup of negative stimuli than from single life events. Time sequences, generated using the random-mood model, produce power plots, phase-space trajectories, and pair-correlation sums, similar to recent results for individual patients. This suggests possible clinical relevance along with the model's use as a tool in survival analysis.",2006-May,Archives of general psychiatry,Journal Article,2006,YES,sa,"What type of stochastic process is used to model mood dynamics in reversible depression, and how does it explain the incubation phase observed in recovery?",An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic process driven by intermittent Gaussian noise explains mood dynamics; the incubation phase is an artifact from diagnostic criteria requiring a 14-day depressive state.,"The abstract describes mood dynamics as intermittent noise in an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and attributes the incubation phase to diagnostic inclusion criteria, not inherent pathology."
16979244,Diagnostic variability for schizophrenia and major depression in a large public mental health care system dataset.,"Administrative datasets can provide information about mental health treatment in real world settings; however, an important limitation in using these datasets is the uncertainty regarding psychiatric diagnosis. To better understand the psychiatric diagnoses, we investigated the diagnostic variability of schizophrenia and major depression in a large public mental health system. Using schizophrenia and major depression as the two comparison diagnoses, we compared the variability of diagnoses assigned to patients with one recorded diagnosis of schizophrenia or major depression. In addition, for both of these diagnoses, the diagnostic variability was compared across seven types of treatment settings. Statistical analyses were conducted using t tests for continuous data and chi-square tests for categorical data. We found that schizophrenia had greater diagnostic variability than major depression (31% vs. 43%). For both schizophrenia and major depression, variability was significantly higher in jail and the emergency psychiatric unit than in inpatient or outpatient settings. These findings demonstrate that the variability of psychiatric diagnoses recorded in the administrative dataset of a large public mental health system varies by diagnosis and by treatment setting.

The Discomfort Intolerance Scale (DIS), a self-report measure of discomfort intolerance, was evaluated using a variety of samples (total N approximately 1700), including patients with panic disorder, clinical controls, and nonclinical community members. Factor analyses suggest the DIS contains two factors, including a factor indexing the ability to tolerate discomfort and pain (Factor 1: alpha = .91), and a factor, which appears to measure avoidance of physical discomfort (Factor 2: alpha = .72). Cross-time reliability shows good stability across 12 weeks (Factor 1 = .63, Factor 2 = .66).

Thirty-two first-degree relatives of patients treated in the ICU of two general hospitals were investigated for symptoms of early posttraumatic stress reaction, anxiety, and depression. Patients' and relatives' sociodemographic data and information pertaining to the patients' ICU treatment were collected. Family members were assessed at intake and before discharge through the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Impact of Event Scale. High rates of anxiety, depressive (97%), and posttraumatic stress (81%) symptoms were recorded at the initial assessment. Although symptoms remitted significantly, 87% and 59% of the sample fulfilled the criteria for a depressive and posttraumatic stress reaction, respectively, at the second assessment. Women exhibited higher levels of distress and more persisting symptoms than men did. Trait anxiety was the most significant predictor (P<.001) of the severity of depressive symptoms and the single predictor of the development of posttraumatic stress reaction (P<.000); also, state anxiety was a predictor of the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms, especially of the female gender. Family members of ICU patients exhibit high levels of distress that persist throughout their relatives' hospitalization.

16482085,Hippocampal cytogenesis correlates to escitalopram-mediated recovery in a chronic mild stress rat model of depression.,"From clinical studies it is known that recurrent depressive episodes associate with a reduced hippocampal volume. Conversely, preclinical studies have shown that chronic antidepressant treatment increases hippocampal neurogenesis. Consequently, it has been suggested that a deficit in hippocampal neurogenesis is implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. To study a potential correlation between recovery and hippocampal cytogenesis, we established the chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model of depression. When rats are subjected to CMS, several depressive symptoms develop, including the major symptom anhedonia. Rats were exposed to stress for 2 weeks and subsequently to stress in combination with antidepressant treatment for 4 consecutive weeks. The behavioral deficit measured in anhedonic animals is a reduced intake of a sucrose solution. Prior to perfusion animals were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of proliferating cells. Brains were sectioned horizontally and newborn cells positive for BrdU were counted in the dentate gyrus and tracked in a dorsoventral direction.CMS significantly decreased sucrose consumption and cytogenesis in the ventral part of the hippocampal formation. During exposure to the antidepressant escitalopram, given as intraperitoneally dosages of either 5 or 10 mg/kg/day, animals distributed in a bimodal fashion into a group, which recovered (increase in sucrose consumption), and a subgroup, which refracted treatment (no increase in sucrose consumption). Chronic treatment with escitalopram reversed the CMS-induced decrease in cytogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the ventral hippocampal formation, but in recovered animals only. Our data show a correlation between recovery from anhedonia, as measured by cessation of behavioral deficits in the CMS model, and an increase in cytogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the ventral hippocampal formation.",2006-Nov,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2006,YES,sa,What neurobiological change in the hippocampus is correlated with recovery from anhedonia in a chronic mild stress model of depression?,Increased cytogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the ventral hippocampal formation.,"The abstract states that recovery from anhedonia, as measured by increased sucrose consumption, correlates with an increase in cytogenesis specifically in the ventral dentate gyrus of the hippocampus following chronic escitalopram treatment."

16968574,"A comparative, randomized, double-blind study of trazodone prolonged-release and sertraline in the treatment of major depressive disorder.","To evaluate the efficacy and safety of trazodone prolonged-release compared with sertraline in the treatment of patients with major depression. A total of 122 patients aged 19-64 years were enrolled in this multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, comparator-controlled study. Patients received 7 days of single-blind placebo treatment followed by 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with trazodone prolonged-release 150-450 mg/day (n = 62) or sertraline 50-100 mg/day (n = 60). Efficacy was evaluated by mean changes from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D), Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale, and the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement/Severity scores; and by the rates of patients responding to treatment and considered to be in remission. Time to onset of efficacy and safety were assessed. Trazodone and sertraline were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms and promoting remission, and had similar onset times. In the Intent-to-Treat population, there were no significant differences in favor of trazodone at study endpoint in all efficacy measures, while a statistically significant difference was detected in the Per-Protocol population on HAM-D and in the percentage of responders. Analysis of HAM-D factors (anxiety/somatization, cognitive disturbance, retardation, and sleep disturbance) indicated that sleep disturbances were significantly less evident for patients taking trazodone at study endpoint. Adverse drug reactions, mostly of mild intensity, were reported in 42% of trazodone-treated patients (mainly of the nervous system) and 43% of sertraline-treated patients (mainly gastrointestinal). One event was considered to be serious: a patient treated with trazodone 450 mg/day showed moderate anxiety/tremor/insomnia and was hospitalized. Treatment was discontinued; the patient made a full recovery. This study showed that after 6 weeks, trazodone and sertraline were not different in reducing symptoms of depression and in producing disease remission.

16754265,The warpy thoughts scale: a new 20-item instrument to measure dysfunctional attitudes.,"Cognitive theories of psychopathology propose that specific negative cognitive schema held by individuals can increase their likelihood of experiencing depressive episodes. While it has been argued that such dysfunctional attitudes are state measures that occur primarily during periods of depression, a range of research has supported the view that holding dysfunctional attitudes is ongoing, persisting prior to and following depressive episodes. To date, the need for a parsimonious measure of dysfunctional attitudes has not been well addressed. Using data provided by 4545 participants in a free on-line cognitive behavioural therapy program, MoodGYM, we have developed the Warpy Thoughts Scale (WTS), a 20-item instrument measuring dysfunctional attitudes. This scale provides 3 first order factors (Relationships, Achievements and Entitlements) and a higher order factor, Warpy Thoughts, from which a Warpy Thoughts score can be obtained. Confirmatory factor analyses on this model indicated that it provides robust results for men and women and for individuals in a wide range of ages. WTS scores were moderately correlated with levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (0.39 and 0.40, respectively) and explained up to one-fifth of the variance of these mental health measures. Further validation of the WTS against other measures of dysfunctional thoughts is required.",2006,Cognitive behaviour therapy,Journal Article,2006,YES,sa,"What higher-order cognitive construct has been identified as encompassing dysfunctional attitudes related to relationships, achievements, and entitlements, and how is it linked to depressive and anxiety symptoms?",Warpy Thoughts; it is moderately correlated with depressive (0.39) and anxiety (0.40) symptoms.,"The Warpy Thoughts construct, measured by the WTS, includes first-order factors of Relationships, Achievements, and Entitlements.

16503815,Managing depressive and anxiety disorders with escitalopram.,"This article reviews escitalopram, the S-stereoisomer of the racemic compound citalopram, and a highly selective and potent member of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor class of antidepressants. Escitalopram has a straightforward pharmacokinetic profile, little effect on hepatic metabolism, and is relatively safe in overdose. Similar to other members of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor class, escitalopram (10-20 mg/day) is a well-tolerated and effective treatment of major depressive disorder. Although relatively few head-to-head comparative studies with other antidepressants have been published, pooled analyses of studies using citalopram as the active comparator suggest a modest advantage for the stereoisomer. This advantage, which is more apparent among patients with greater symptom levels, may be attributable to a greater than predicted potency compared with citalopram, presumably as a result of the greater effect of escitalopram at the allosteric binding site of the serotonin transporter. Results of two published studies versus venlafaxine also suggest better tolerability in the context of comparable efficacy. Escitalopram is also approved for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (in the US) and social anxiety disorder and panic disorder (in the EU). Pharmacoeconomic models suggest that the greater drug acquisition cost of this patent-protected compound may be offset by greater efficacy (relative to generic citalopram) and tolerability (compared with extended release venlafaxine).",2006-Mar,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review,2006,YES,sa,What pharmacological property of escitalopram might explain its greater efficacy in patients with severe depressive symptoms compared to citalopram?,Its greater effect at the allosteric binding site of the serotonin transporter.,"The abstract states that escitalopram's advantage over citalopram, particularly in patients with greater symptom severity, is likely due to its greater potency at the allosteric binding site of the serotonin transporter."
16407586,Psychosocial and vascular risk factors for depression in the elderly.,"The objective of this study was to examine two competing hypotheses as they relate to the relationship between vascular and psychosocial risk factors for late-life depression. The stress-vulnerability hypothesis predicts that the depressogenic effect of psychosocial risk is stronger in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). The other predicts that psychosocial risk factors and vascular risk factors are independent pathways to depression and that there is no combined effect of vascular risk factors and life stress. This study consisted of a longitudinal design (baseline, six-, and 12-month follow-up) predicting new episodes of significant depressive symptoms (CES-D >16) in 1,474 community-dwelling elders with low levels of depression at baseline (CES-D <8). There was a significant interaction between stress at wave 2 and CVRFs at baseline such that stress was a stronger predictor of wave 2 depression in participants who had two or more CVRFs. There was no evidence that CVRFs played a larger role in depression not preceded by a stressful life event than in depression that was preceded by a stressful life event. The depressogenic effect of stress was stronger in the presence of significant vascular risk (CVRFs). Vascular risk may increase one's vulnerability to depression by exacerbating the impact of stress on depression. One hypothesis for this finding is that vascular disease disrupts mood regulation circuits in the brain, which decrease its ability to respond to stressful events.",2006-Jan,The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,Journal Article,2006,YES,sa,How might cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) influence the relationship between life stress and the development of late-life depression?,"CVRFs amplify the depressogenic effect of life stress, increasing vulnerability to depression.","The abstract indicates that stress is a stronger predictor of depression in individuals with two or more CVRFs, suggesting CVRFs exacerbate the impact of stress on depression."

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis measures were assessed at rest and during mental stress, as well as sensitivity to cold pressor and tourniquet ischemic pain tasks in four groups of women: (1) non-PMDD with no prior MDD (N=18); (2) non-PMDD with prior MDD (N=9); (3) PMDD with no prior MDD (N=17); (4) PMDD with prior MDD (N=10). PMDD women showed blunted SNS responses to stress compared to non-PMDD women, irrespective of prior MDD; while women with prior MDD showed exaggerated diastolic blood pressure responses to stress versus never depressed women, irrespective of PMDD. However, only in women with histories of MDD did PMDD women have lower cortisol concentrations than non-PMDD women, and only in non-PMDD women was MDD associated with reduced cold pressor pain sensitivity.

A relationship of Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism and hippocampal volumes in 33 MDD patients and 40 healthy controls is investigated. Region of interest analysis was conducted on the images acquired via MRI. Depressed patients had smaller left hippocampal volumes compared to healthy controls. The diagnosis of MDD was not significantly related to hippocampal volumes among Met carriers; however, among Val homozygotes depressed patients had significantly smaller left hippocampal volumes compared to controls. Although both right and left hippocampal volumes showed nearly significant correlation with the duration of illness, this correlation reached (negative) significant levels only in the right hippocampal volume of the Val homozygotes.

20584925,Clorgyline-mediated reversal of neurological deficits in a Complexin 2 knockout mouse.,"Complexin 2 is a protein modulator of neurotransmitter release that is downregulated in humans suffering from depression, animal models of depression and neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease in which depression is a major symptom. Although complexin 2 knockout (Cplx2-/-) mice are overtly normal, they show significant abnormalities in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Here we show that Cplx2-/- mice also have disturbances in emotional behaviours that include abnormal social interactions and depressive-like behaviour. Since neurotransmitter deficiencies are thought to underlie depression, we examined neurotransmitter levels in Cplx2-/- mice and found a significant decrease in levels of noradrenaline and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with clorgyline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, restored hippocampal noradrenaline to normal levels (from 60 to 97% of vehicle-treated Cplx2+/+ mice, P<0.001), and reversed the behavioural deficits seen in Cplx2-/- mice. For example, clorgyline-treated Cplx2-/- mice spent significantly more time interacting with a novel visitor mouse compared with vehicle-treated Cplx2-/- mice in the social recognition test (34 compared with 13%, P<0.01). We were also able to reverse the selective deficit seen in mossy fibre-long-term potentiation (MF-LTP) in Cplx2-/- mice using the noradrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Pre-treatment with isoprenaline in vitro increased MF-LTP by 125% (P<0.001), thus restoring it to control levels.

20875432,Cannabinoids increase conditioned ultrasonic vocalisations and cat odour avoidance in rats: strain differences in drug-induced anxiety.,"Genetic disposition modulates the psychoactive effects of cannabis. Cannabinoids have a greater impact on brain regions that subserve anxiety in Wistar compared to Lewis strain rats. Here we aim to show that this correlates with strain differences in cannabinoid-induced anxiety-related behaviour. Lewis and Wistar rats were administered vehicle or the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, CP 55,940 (10, 25 and 50μg/kg) before testing in the conditioned ultrasonic vocalization (USV), cat odour avoidance or open area avoidance models. Animals were placed in a chamber in which they had previously received footshock. Wistar but not Lewis rats re-exposed under the influence of all CP 55,940 doses emitted significantly more USVs than vehicle-treated rats. In the cat odour avoidance model, rats were exposed to cat odour and given the opportunity to hide in a small box. In Wistar but not Lewis rats, 50μg/kg of CP 55,940 magnified hiding behaviour promoted by cat odour exposure. Animals were also tested in the open area avoidance model which occurred in the same arena as the predatory avoidance model but without cat odour. In Wistar, but not Lewis rats, 25 and 50μg/kg of CP 55,940 increased the avoidance of the open space. CP 55,940 increased anxiety-related behaviour in Wistar rats but not Lewis rats providing a model to dissect the genetic basis of cannabinoid-induced anxiety.

20839171,[Depression and diabetes: from epidemiology to neurobiology].,"Worldwide, diabetes mellitus and depression are among the most prevalent diseases in their respective fields, metabolism and psychiatry. However, there is evidence that patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing depression, although a bidirectional relationship might also exist. To present a comprehensive review of the clinical, epidemiological, psychosocial, emotional, and neurobiological basis of the relation between diabetes and depression. Epidemiological studies indicate that there is not only an augmented risk of developing depression in diabetic patients, but that this association increases the morbidity and mortality of these patients. While there is a considerable number of clinical studies that support this relation, little is known about the neurochemical mechanisms that would constitute its biological basis. Alterations in monoamines (serotonin and noradrenaline), the increases in cortisol by the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and trophic agents such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, through glycogen synthase kinase-3, constitute some of the abnormalities documented in diabetic patients and in animal models that could explain the association between depression and diabetes.

20650447,Components of interference control predict depressive symptoms and rumination cross-sectionally and at six months follow-up.,"Recent research has shown that depression is characterized by difficulties inhibiting irrelevant emotional material and that these difficulties are linked to rumination. The present study examined the relation among tasks that assess different aspects of interference control, depressive symptoms, and rumination, cross-sectionally and in a 6-months follow-up. 111 participants completed an emotional flanker task to assess individual differences in resolving interference from simultaneously presented irrelevant stimuli. In addition, participants completed two negative affective priming tasks using word and face stimuli to assess difficulty controlling interference from internal representations of previously rejected material. Six months after the initial session, depressive symptoms and rumination were re-assessed. Depressive symptoms at time 1 were related to individual differences in negative priming for verbal as well as pictorial material, but not to individual differences in interference resolution from simultaneously presented external stimuli in the flanker task. Individual differences in negative priming at time 1 further predicted depressive symptoms and rumination at time 2.

20872753,Psychological and behavioral risk profiles as they relate to eating disorder diagnoses and symptomatology among a school-based sample of youth.,"Examine substance use, depression, self-esteem, and suicidality by eating disorder (ED) classifications among nonclinical youth. A school-based sample of 4,746 youth completed anthropometric measures and Project EAT survey items matched to DSM-IV ED criteria. Logistic regression analyses and general linear models compared three threshold (AN, BN, or BED), two subthreshold (binge-eating and/or compensatory behaviors not meeting ED diagnosis, or body image disturbance without disordered eating) and one asymptomatic ED classifications. Subthreshold and threshold classifications reported lower self-esteem and greater substance use, depression, suicidal ideation/attempts than asymptomatic youth. The BED group had higher depressive mood, and BED and BN had lower self-esteem, than the subthreshold groups. Odds ratios for suicidality were highest among the BN group and lowest among the body image disturbance group.

20478879,Incidence and predictors of suicide attempts in DSM-IV major depressive disorder: a five-year prospective study.,"Prospective long-term studies of risk factors for suicide attempts among patients with major depressive disorder have not investigated the course of illness and state at the time of the act. Therefore, the importance of state factors, particularly time spent in risk states, for overall risk remains unknown. In the Vantaa Depression Study, a longitudinal 5-year evaluation of psychiatric patients with major depressive disorder, prospective information on 249 patients (92.6%) was available. Time spent in depressive states and the timing of suicide attempts were investigated with life charts. During the follow-up assessment period, there were 106 suicide attempts per 1,018 patient-years. The incidence rate per 1,000 patient-years during major depressive episodes was 21-fold (N=332 [95% confidence interval [CI]=258.6-419.2]), and it was fourfold during partial remission (N=62 [95% CI=34.6-92.4]) compared with full remission (N=16 [95% CI=11.2-40.2]). In the Cox proportional hazards model, suicide attempts were predicted by the months spent in a major depressive episode (hazard ratio=7.74 [95% CI=3.40-17.6]) or in partial remission (hazard ratio=4.20 [95% CI=1.71-10.3]), history of suicide attempts (hazard ratio=4.39 [95% CI=1.78-10.8]), age (hazard ratio=0.94 [95% CI=0.91-0.98]), lack of a partner (hazard ratio=2.33 [95% CI=0.97-5.56]), and low perceived social support (hazard ratio=3.57 [95% CI=1.09-11.1]). The adjusted population attributable fraction of the time spent depressed for suicide attempts was 78%. Among patients with major depressive disorder, incidence of suicide attempts varies markedly depending on the level of depression, being highest during major depressive episodes. Although previous attempts and poor social support also indicate risk, the time spent depressed is likely the major factor determining overall long-term risk.",2010-Jul,The American journal of psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2010,YES,sa,What clinical factors most strongly predict suicide attempts in patients with major depressive disorder over a long-term follow-up?,"Time spent in major depressive episodes, partial remission, prior suicide attempts, younger age, lack of a partner, and low perceived social support.","The abstract identifies time spent depressed (78% attributable risk), prior attempts, younger age, lack of a partner, and low social support as major predictors of suicide attempts in major depressive disorder."
24917438,Elevated salivary α-amylase and cortisol levels in unremitted and remitted depressed patients.,"Abstract Objective. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis via chronic stress. Psychosocial stress-induced activation of salivary α-amylase (sAA) represents sympathoadrenal medullary system (SAM) activity, and sAA has become an emerging biomarker for sympathetic nervous system activity. In contrast to salivary cortisol, sAA has been less extensively studied in depressed patients. The present study sought to address this problem by measuring sAA and salivary cortisol levels in patients with major depressive disorder. Methods. The authors recorded Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores along with, levels of sAA and salivary cortisol in 28 patients with unremitted major depressive disorder, 43 remitted patients and 103 healthy volunteers. Results. STAI (State or Trait) measurements in unremitted patients with MDD were significantly increased compared with healthy controls and remitted patients. SAA and cortisol levels in unremitted patients were also significantly elevated compared to controls and remitted patients. Finally, sAA levels were significantly correlated with HRSD in unremitted patients with MDD. Conclusion. These preliminary results suggest that sAA may be a state-dependent marker of major depressive disorder in addition to salivary cortisol.",2010-Nov,International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,Journal Article,2010,YES,sa,How can salivary α-amylase (sAA) levels aid in differentiating unremitted major depressive disorder from remitted MDD and healthy controls?,"Elevated sAA levels can indicate unremitted MDD, as they are significantly higher in these patients compared to remitted MDD and healthy controls.","The abstract states that sAA levels are significantly elevated in unremitted MDD patients versus remitted patients and controls, suggesting sAA as a state-dependent marker for MDD."
20456342,The neuropsychiatric phenotype in Darier disease.,"Darier disease (DD) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited skin disorder in which co-occurrence of neuropsychiatric abnormalities has been frequently reported by dermatologists. It is caused by mutations in a single gene, ATP2A2, which is expressed in the skin and brain. To conduct the first systematic investigation of the neuropsychiatric phenotype in DD. One hundred unrelated individuals with DD were assessed using a battery of standardized neuropsychiatric measures. Data were also obtained on a number of clinical features of DD. Individuals with DD were found to have high lifetime rates of mood disorders (50%), specifically major depression (30%) and bipolar disorder (4%), and suicide attempts (13%) and suicidal thoughts (31%). These were more common in DD when compared with general population data. The prevalence of epilepsy (3%) in the sample was also higher than the prevalence in the general population. There was no consistent association of specific dermatological features of DD and presence of psychiatric features. These findings highlight the need for clinicians to assess and recognize neuropsychiatric symptoms in DD. The results do not suggest that neuropsychiatric symptoms are simply a psychological reaction to having a skin disease, but are consistent with the pleiotropy hypothesis that mutations in the ATP2A2 gene, in addition to causing DD, confer susceptibility to neuropsychiatric features. Further research is needed to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations between the types and/or locations of pathogenic mutations within ATP2A2 and the expressed neuropsychiatric phenotypes.",2010-Sep,The British journal of dermatology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2010,YES,sa,"What genetic mutation is associated with increased susceptibility to both Darier disease and mood disorders, including major depression?",Mutations in the ATP2A2 gene.,"The abstract states that ATP2A2 mutations cause Darier disease and confer susceptibility to neuropsychiatric features, including mood disorders like major depression, supporting the pleiotropy hypothesis."
20094002,Pediatric mental health concerns in the emergency department: caregiver and youth perceptions and expectations.,"The main purpose of this research was to identify the perceived mental health (MH) concerns of caregivers and youths who present to the emergency department (ED) for MH services. The concordance between caregiver and youth perceptions and clinician ratings of MH concerns were evaluated. Expectations for the visit and perceived stressors that triggered the event are described. This study consisted of 241 youths accompanied by caregivers presenting to the ED for MH concerns requiring crisis intervention services. The Caregiver Perception Survey and Youth Perception Survey were completed. These surveys were designed to identify the caregivers' and youths' main concerns and perceived stressors, as well as their expectations in coming to the pediatric ED. A chi analysis was conducted to determine the percentage of agreement of reported MH concerns between groups (youth, caregiver, and clinician), and kappa statistics are reported. Caregivers' and youths' top 5 concerns were suicide ideation, depression or mood, suicidal attempt, anxiety, and self-injury. The top 3 stresses identified by both youths and their caregivers were school, issues with parents, and problems with friends/peers. The top 3 expectations that were noted by caregivers were help/guidance for child, assessment/ evaluation/diagnosis, and health care professional resources. Concordance rates between caregivers and youths for the top 5 concerns ranged from 39.4% to 80.6%. Concordance rates between clinician rating of concerns (as requiring some or immediate action) and caregiver concerns ranged from 18.4% to 45.2%. Concordance rates between clinician and youth ranged from 11.1% to 59.4%. The top 5 caregivers and youths' main concerns for coming to the ED were similar. However, concordance between perceived concern and clinician assessment is low.

20926994,Assessment of infant dose through milk in a lactating woman taking amisulpride and desvenlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression.,"This study presents the case of a 35-year-old breastfeeding mother who delivered her fourth child 5 months previously and was prescribed 100 mg amisulpride twice daily and 250 mg desvenlafaxine in the morning for treatment-resistant depression. Arriving at this regimen took approximately 2 months postbirth. Because she was keen to continue breastfeeding her infant, and published data on the use of amisulpride and desvenlafaxine were very limited, the clinical team sought assistance from the therapeutic drug monitoring laboratory to quantify infant dose-exposure to guide consideration of continuing breastfeeding. A sampling schedule for milk and plasma from mother and plasma from her infant was agreed and drug concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Absolute (theoretic) infant dose (μg/kg/d) was calculated as the product of the average concentration in milk and an assumed milk intake of 0.15 L/kg/day (294 mg/kg/day for desvenlafaxine and 183 mg/kg/day for amisulpride), and relative infant dose was estimated as absolute infant dose expressed as a percentage of the maternal dose in μg/kg/day (7.8% for desvenlafaxine and 6.1% for amisulpride). Consistent with the infant being partially breastfed, the ratio of drug in the infant's plasma to that in mother's plasma was lower at 1.7% for desvenlafaxine and 3.9% for amisulpride. A pediatric assessment of the infant found achievement of expected developmental progress for age and no detectable drug-related adverse effects. Assessing the safety of breastfeeding was difficult because it involved simultaneous use of two drugs for which there was limited previous experience. However, after discussion of the infant dose-exposure data and lack of adverse effects, the mother elected to continue partial breastfeeding for the next few months. The clinical team plans a reassessment of the infant's progress in 3 months.",2010-Dec,Therapeutic drug monitoring,Case Reports; Journal Article,2010,YES,sa,What factors should be considered when assessing the safety of breastfeeding in a mother taking amisulpride and desvenlafaxine for treatment-resistant depression?,"Infant dose-exposure (absolute and relative), drug concentration ratios (infant-to-maternal plasma), developmental progress, and absence of adverse effects.","The abstract highlights absolute/relative infant doses, plasma concentration ratios, and developmental assessments as key indicators for evaluating breastfeeding safety in mothers on amisulpride and desvenlafaxine."
20303180,Alexithymia is associated with anxiety among adolescents.,"The aim of this study was to explore the possible association between alexithymia and anxiety in a non-clinical sample of late adolescents. The questionnaire was sent to 935 adolescents of whom 729 (78%) responded, thus forming the final sample. The mean age of the subjects was 19 years (range 17-21 years). The Finnish versions of the following scales were used: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) was used to assess alexithymia, and anxiety symptoms were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Alcohol consumption was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and depression symptoms were evaluated using the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory, as modified by Raitasalo (RBDI). The prevalence of alexithymia in the sample was 8.2%, with no statistically significant gender difference. The alexithymic subjects had significantly (p<0.001) higher mean STAI scores than the non-alexithymic subjects. A vast majority of the alexithymic subjects were highly anxious, in contrast to the low proportion among the non-alexithymic subjects. The highly anxious alexithymic subjects differed statistically and significantly from the highly anxious non-alexithymic subjects, with higher scores both in the AUDIT and the RBDI. The results are based on self-reported material alone and the cross-sectional design used in this study precludes the assessment of causal links.

20586534,Altered auditory processing in patients with panic disorder: a pilot study.,"Clinical and electrophysiological studies suggest that panic disorder (PD) patients show disturbed response inhibition to sensory stimuli. Thus, habituation of neuronal activation after repeated sine tone stimulation was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with PD. Twenty patients with PD and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were assessed by 3T fMRI for auditory habituation. During three stimulation cycles of digitally generated pulsed (ν=5 Hz) 800-Hz sine tones alternating with silent periods, activation of the auditory cortex and other anxiety- or sensory integration-related regions was assessed. Brain activation was further analyzed dependent on functional serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene variation (5-HTTLPR). PD patients demonstrated an extended brain activity in the first stimulation block, which normalized during the second stimulation cycle. A positive correlation with anxiety measures (HAMA) and an increased activity of distinct anxiety- or sensory integration-related areas (e.g., BA 22, BA 10) were seen during the third block of auditory stimulation. There was a significant interaction of left amygdala activation and the 5-HTTLPR S allele. Our results support the hypothesis of an aberrant processing of sensory information in PD patients.

20728493,Differential regulation of neurotrophin S100B and BDNF in two rat models of depression.,"Several clinical studies have demonstrated that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are decreased and serum S100B levels are increased in patients with major depression. In this study, we investigated whether these findings could be replicated in animal models of depression. We measured BDNF and S100B protein levels in the serum, prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus of rats in models of depression, i.e., olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) models. Serum BDNF levels were significantly increased in the OBX rats, as were hippocampal BDNF levels in the CUS rats, in comparison with their respective controls. Significant increases in serum S100B levels were observed in both the OBX and CUS rats as compared with their respective controls; however, S100B levels were decreased in the prefrontal cortex of the CUS rats. No significant correlation was found between serum and regional brain S100B/BDNF levels. Our findings suggest that both of these animal models of depression, in which similar serum S100B level changes to those in depressed patients were observed, could be used as valid models to explore the role of S100B underlying major depression.

19074537,The effects of acute tryptophan depletion on affective behaviour and cognition in Brown Norway and Sprague Dawley rats.,"Previous studies in rats and humans have shown that the essential amino acid tryptophan (TRP) is depleted after consumption of a gelatin-based protein-carbohydrate mixture, which is lacking L-tryptophan (TRP-). In rats, TRP depletion caused impaired object recognition but only had a modest effect on affective behaviour. Because these studies were preformed with Wistar rats, the aim of the present experiment was to evaluate strain differences in behavioural responses to acute TRP depletion between Brown Norway (BN) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The rats were repeatedly treated with TRP- or a balanced control (TRP+) and were tested in tests of anxiety- and depression-related behaviour (open-field test, home cage emergence test, social interaction test, forced swim test) and memory. SD rats, but not BNs, showed more anxiety- and depression-related behaviour and impaired object recognition after TRP- treatment. There was a dissociation between plasma TRP levels, central 5-HT concentrations and 5-HIAA/5-HT turnover. Both strains showed about 60% decrease in plasma TRP/SigmaLNAA levels, whereas hippocampal 5-HT levels were lower after TRP- in BN but not SD rats. Conversely, 5-HIAA/5-HT turnover was lower after TRP- in SD but not BN rats, suggesting a dissociation between 5-HT storage and release in SDs.

The study sample consisted of 3503 adults from the Chicago Health and Aging project, an ongoing, population-based, biracial (59% African American) study in adults aged > or =65 y. Dietary assessment was made by food-frequency questionnaire. Incident depression was measured by the presence of > or =4 depressive symptoms from the 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale.

20100303,A narrative review of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and implications for its use in an alcohol-dependent population.,"The findings from the present study reveal that the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring depression in a variety of populations. This realization should enable nurses and other health professionals to utilize the tool with added confidence and assurance. * The main finding was that the BDI would probably be a reliable and valid screening tool in an alcohol-dependent population. This conclusion appears to echo the relationship that alcohol consumption generally has with depression. This finding is important to those practitioners using the BDI in this population in that it provides further evidence to enhance their practical experience. Abstract A psychometric evaluation of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was carried out on contemporary studies to ascertain its suitability for use in an alcohol-dependent population. Three criteria were used for this: factor analysis, test-retest reliability and internal consistency reliability. Factor analysis revealed that its structure is consistent with either two or three factor models, depending on the population. Test-retest results concluded that the correlation coefficient remained above the recommended threshold and internal consistency reliability highlighted alpha coefficient results consistently above suggested scores, leading to the conclusion that the BDI is probably an effective screening tool in an alcohol-dependent population.",2010-Feb,Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing,Journal Article; Review,2010,YES,sa,What psychometric properties make the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suitable for screening depression in alcohol-dependent populations?,"Factor analysis consistency, test-retest reliability above threshold, and internal consistency reliability with high alpha coefficients.","The abstract states the BDI's structure fits factor models, test-retest correlation exceeds thresholds, and alpha coefficients consistently meet reliability standards, supporting its use in alcohol-dependent populations."
20227247,Case-control study of the relationship of depressive symptoms to suicide in a community-based sample of individuals with schizophrenia in China.,"Suicide is the leading cause of premature death among people with schizophrenia. Most studies on suicide and schizophrenia report an associated depression history, but they are based on clinical samples from mostly western countries. We conducted a secondary analysis of 74 suicides (cases) and 24 accidental deaths (controls) among persons with schizophrenia identified in a national psychological autopsy study in mainland China using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. A 'depression symptom severity score' based on number, severity, and persistence of depressive symptoms 2 weeks before death was derived from psychiatric interviews with 2 informants; determination of a 'dysfunction due to depressive symptoms score' was based on informants' reports about effects of depressive symptoms on decedents' functioning in the month before death. In addition, the mean number of negative life events was determined along with the effect of the events on the decedent. Comparison of the measures made for cases and controls were made by univariate analysis followed by adjustments using the False Discovery Rate. Compared to persons with schizophrenia who died by accident, those who died by suicide were more likely to have a recent DSM IV diagnosis of major depression, the symptom of depressed mood, thoughts of death and a prior suicide attempt. In addition, those who died by suicide were more likely to have a higher overall depression severity score and greater dysfunction due to depressive symptoms. This community-based study of individuals with DSM-IV schizophrenia who died by suicide in a non-western culture extends findings from clinical studies in western cultures providing data on the importance of depressive symptoms as risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia in a low income rural setting. These findings underline the importance of routine screening for depressive symptoms among patients with schizophrenia.",2010-Sep,Schizophrenia research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2010,YES,sa,What depressive symptom-related factors significantly differentiate individuals with schizophrenia who die by suicide from those who die by accidental death?,"Recent major depression diagnosis, depressed mood, thoughts of death, prior suicide attempt, higher depression severity score, and greater dysfunction due to depressive symptoms.","The abstract identifies these factors as significantly more common in suicide cases compared to accidental death cases among individuals with schizophrenia, emphasizing their clinical relevance."
20520284,MRP1 polymorphisms associated with citalopram response in patients with major depression.,"Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1) transports antidepressive agents in the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, polymorphisms in the MRP1 gene may affect the treatment response of antidepressants. This study was aimed to identify the association between genetic variations in MRP1/ABCC1 and the therapeutic response to the antidepressant citalopram. One hundred and twenty-three patients who had been treated with citalopram monotherapy to control their major depressive disorder were recruited, and genotype data from 64 patients who had completed their 8-week follow-up were evaluated together with those from 100 controls. Nine MRP1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing more than 5% allele frequency in the Korean population were analyzed. The c.4002G>A, a synonymous SNP in exon 28, showed a strong association with the remission state at 8 weeks (P = 0.005, odds ratio [OR], 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 approximately 14.7). The c.4002G>A forms a linkage disequilibrium block with 3 other SNPs including c.5462T>A in the 3' untranslated region. Accordingly, the haplotype showed a significant association with the remission state (P = 0.014). Subsequent molecular studies also supported the association between these MRP1 polymorphisms and the citalopram response. Thus, kinetic studies using MRP1-enriched membrane vesicles revealed that citalopram is a substrate of MRP1 (Km = 1.99 microM, Vmax = 137 pmol/min per milligram protein). In addition, individuals with c.4002G>A or c.5462T>A polymorphisms showed higher MRP1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood cells. These results suggest that MRP1 polymorphisms may be a predictive marker of citalopram treatment in major depression.",2010-Apr,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2010,YES,sa,"What genetic factor may predict remission in patients with major depressive disorder treated with citalopram, and how does it influence treatment response?","The c.4002G>A polymorphism in the MRP1 gene predicts remission by increasing MRP1 mRNA levels, potentially altering citalopram transport at the blood-brain barrier.","The c.4002G>A polymorphism is associated with higher remission odds (OR 4.7) and increased MRP1 mRNA levels, impacting citalopram's efficacy as MRP1 regulates its transport."
19236730,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF) gene: no major impact on antidepressant treatment response.,"The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been suggested to play a pivotal role in the aetiology of affective disorders. In order to further clarify the impact of BDNF gene variation on major depression as well as antidepressant treatment response, association of three BDNF polymorphisms [rs7103411, Val66Met (rs6265) and rs7124442] with major depression and antidepressant treatment response was investigated in an overall sample of 268 German patients with major depression and 424 healthy controls. False discovery rate (FDR) was applied to control for multiple testing. Additionally, ten markers in BDNF were tested for association with citalopram outcome in the STAR*D sample. While BDNF was not associated with major depression as a categorical diagnosis, the BDNF rs7124442 TT genotype was significantly related to worse treatment outcome over 6 wk in major depression (p = 0.01) particularly in anxious depression (p = 0.003) in the German sample. However, BDNF rs7103411 and rs6265 similarly predicted worse treatment response over 6 wk in clinical subtypes of depression such as melancholic depression only (rs7103411: TT < CC, p = 0.003; rs6265: GG < AA, p = 0.001). All SNPs had main effects on antidepressant treatment response in ANOVA models when the remaining SNPs were considered as covariates. The STAR*D analyses did not yield significant results at any of the ten BDNF markers. Our results do not support an association between genetic variation in BDNF and antidepressant treatment response or remission. Post-hoc analyses provide some preliminary support for a potential minor role of genetic variation in BDNF and antidepressant treatment outcome in the context of melancholic depression.",2010-Feb,The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,"Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",2010,YES,sa,"Which BDNF polymorphism is associated with a worse antidepressant treatment response specifically in anxious depression, and what is the genotype involved?","BDNF rs7124442, TT genotype.","The abstract states that the BDNF rs7124442 TT genotype is significantly related to worse treatment outcomes in anxious depression (p = 0.003), highlighting its specific relevance to this clinical subtype."
20708315,Internalized homophobia and internalizing mental health problems: a meta-analytic review.,"Research on internalized homophobia (IH) has linked it to both mental and physical health outcomes. Extant research indicates that IH and mental health are related in a variety of different subgroups of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) persons. However, much of this research has suffered from methodological issues. Studies have frequently substituted distress-related constructs (e.g., self-esteem and general well-being) for measures of internalizing mental health problems. Furthermore, many studies have misapplied measures of IH designed for gay men with lesbian samples. The current study used Hierarchical Linear Modeling to perform meta-analysis. Effect sizes were combined across multiple studies that used dimensional measures of internalizing mental health problems (i.e., depression and anxiety). The use of multilevel modeling techniques allowed for the evaluation of moderating effects on these relationships, including those of gender, year of data collection, mean age of the sample, publication type, and type of symptomatology measured. Thirty-one studies were meta-analyzed for the relationship between IH and mental health (N=5831), revealing a small to moderate overall effect size for the relationship between the two variables. Higher levels of IH were associated with higher scores on dimensional measures of internalizing mental health problems. Significant moderating effects were also found for mean age of the sample and the type of symptomatology measured in each study. The relationship between IH and internalizing mental health problems was stronger in studies with a higher mean age. The relationship between IH and depressive symptomatology was stronger than the relationship between IH and symptoms of anxiety. Limitations and future research directions are discussed as well as implications for clinical practice.",2010-Dec,Clinical psychology review,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis; Review,2010,YES,sa,How does internalized homophobia differentially impact depressive symptoms versus anxiety symptoms in LGB individuals?,Internalized homophobia has a stronger relationship with depressive symptoms than with anxiety symptoms.,The meta-analysis found that the relationship between internalized homophobia and depressive symptomatology was stronger than its relationship with anxiety symptoms.
20207007,Diagnostic validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in cancer and palliative settings: a meta-analysis.,"To examine the validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in the identification of psychiatric complications of cancer, as defined by a robust criterion standard. 50 analyses tested the depression subscale (HADS-D), anxiety subscale (HADS-A) or combined scales (HADS-T) against syndromal (clinical) depression (n=22), syndromal anxiety (n=4) or any mental ill health/distress (n=24), all defined by semi-structured psychiatric interview. The HADS and its subscales had both strengths and limitations. Overall it appeared to perform marginally better in non-palliative cancer settings. Specific findings for each subscale were as follows. In the identification of depression the HADS-T, HADS-D and HADS-A had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 82.0%, 77.0%; 71.6%, 82.6% and 80.5%, 77.8%, respectively. All versions performed poorly in case-finding but well in a screening capacity. For anxiety there were no HADS-D studies. The HADS-T and HADS-A had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 83.9%, 69.9% and 48.7%, 78.7%. They were poor at case-finding but good as screening instruments. For distress (any mental ill health) the HADS-T, HADS-D and HADS-A had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 72.8%, 80.6%; 75.7%, 66.3% and 65.7%, 71.3%, respectively. When screening for distress and anxiety the HADS-T was the optimal subscale. For the identification of depression, anxiety or distress in cancer settings, the HADS (including subscales) is not recommended as a case-finding instrument but it may, subject to concerns about its length, be a suitable addition to screening programme.",2010-Nov,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article; Meta-Analysis,2010,YES,sa,What is the primary limitation of using the HADS-A subscale for identifying clinical anxiety disorders in cancer patients?,Low sensitivity (48.7%) limits its ability to identify true cases of clinical anxiety.,"The abstract states that the HADS-A subscale has a sensitivity of 48.7% for identifying anxiety, making it poor at case-finding despite reasonable specificity (78.7%)."
20728877,Early life stress combined with serotonin 3A receptor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor valine 66 to methionine genotypes impacts emotional brain and arousal correlates of risk for depression.,"Depression will be the second largest burden of disease by 2020. Developing new tools for identifying risk and ultimately prevention of depression relies on elucidating the integrative relationships between susceptibility markers from gene-stress interactions and how they impact emotional brain and arousal systems. They have largely been studied in isolation. We examined how genetic (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] valine 66 to methionine [Val66Met] and serotonin receptor gene 3A [HTR3A]) and early life stress susceptibility factors interact in predicting electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry, emotion-elicited heart rate, and self-reported negativity bias, each correlates of risk for depression. Caucasian volunteers (n = 363) were derived from the Brain Resource International Database, via the Brain Research And Integrative Neuroscience Network. Individuals with both BDNF methionine and HTR3A CC risk genotypes and early life stressors demonstrated a profile of elevated emotion-elicited heart rate and right frontal hyper-activation with right parietotemporal hypoactivation in EEG asymmetry. Elevations in heart rate were a moderator of negativity bias. The findings provide new evidence that these gene-stress susceptibility factors contribute to a brain-arousal profile indicative of risk for depression. They are a step toward identifying biological markers for detecting risk before overt symptoms. It would be valuable for future studies to examine comorbidity and specificity issues; for instance, whether these gene-stress factors contribute in different ways to the partially distinct EEG asymmetry profiles found with anxiety.",2010-Nov-01,Biological psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2010,YES,sa,"How might the interaction between BDNF Val66Met, HTR3A CC genotypes, and early life stress predict EEG asymmetry profiles in patients at risk for depression?",Right frontal hyperactivation and right parietotemporal hypoactivation.,"The abstract states that individuals with these gene-stress factors exhibit EEG asymmetry characterized by right frontal hyperactivation and right parietotemporal hypoactivation, which are indicative of depression risk."
20848875,Screening for major depression in post-myocardial infarction patients: operating characteristics of the Beck Depression Inventory-II.,"To assess the operating characteristics of the Beck-Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and the BDI-II cognitive subscale (BDI-II-cog) in screening for major depression (MDD) in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 131 post-MI patients admitted to an urban academic medical center completed the BDI-II and a semi-structured interview for depression within 72 hours of symptom onset. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, overall correct classification, and likelihood ratios for various cutoff values on both scales were evaluated by comparing scores to interview diagnosis of MDD. Receiver-operator curves (ROC) were also calculated and area under the curve (AUC) measured. The optimal cutoff value for the BDI-II was > or = 16, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 92.1%. Cutoff values of > or = 3 or > or = 4 were both acceptable for the BDI-II-cog (sensitivity = 88.2% and 82.4%, respectively; specificity = 81.6% and 88.6 %, respectively). AUC was 0.96 for the BDI-II and 0.89 for the cognitive subscale. Effective depression screening is important in post-MI patients because of depression's independent association with morbidity and mortality following MI.

19692126,Persistent non-verbal memory impairment in remitted major depression - caused by encoding deficits?,"While neuropsychological impairments are well described in acute phases of major depressive disorders (MDD), little is known about the neuropsychological profile in remission. There is evidence for episodic memory impairments in both acute depressed and remitted patients with MDD. Learning and memory depend on individuals' ability to organize information during learning. This study investigates non-verbal memory functions in remitted MDD and whether nonverbal memory performance is mediated by organizational strategies whilst learning. 30 well-characterized fully remitted individuals with unipolar MDD and 30 healthy controls matching in age, sex and education were investigated. Non-verbal learning and memory were measured by the Rey-Osterrieth-Complex-Figure-Test (RCFT). The RCFT provides measures of planning, organizational skills, perceptual and non-verbal memory functions. For assessing the mediating effects of organizational strategies, we used the Savage Organizational Score. Compared to healthy controls, participants with remitted MDD showed more deficits in their non-verbal memory function. Moreover, participants with remitted MDD demonstrated difficulties in organizing non-verbal information appropriately during learning. In contrast, no impairments regarding visual-spatial functions in remitted MDD were observed. Except for one patient, all the others were taking psychopharmacological medication. The neuropsychological function was solely investigated in the remitted phase of MDD. Individuals with MDD in remission showed persistent non-verbal memory impairments, modulated by a deficient use of organizational strategies during encoding. Therefore, our results strongly argue for additional therapeutic interventions in order to improve these remaining deficits in cognitive function.",2010-Apr,Journal of affective disorders,Journal Article,2010,YES,sa,What cognitive deficit in remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) patients is influenced by impaired organizational strategies during learning?,Non-verbal memory impairment.,"The abstract states that remitted MDD patients show persistent non-verbal memory impairments, which are modulated by deficient organizational strategies during the encoding process, as measured by the RCFT and Savage Organizational Score."
20362978,The process of change in cognitive therapy for depression: predictors of early inter-session symptom gains.,"Although cognitive therapy for depression is an efficacious treatment, questions about the aspects of the therapy that are most critical to successful implementation remain. In a sample of 60 cognitive therapy patients with moderate to severe depression, we examined three aspects of therapists' adherence to cognitive therapy techniques, the patients' facilitation or inhibition of these techniques, and the therapeutic alliance as predictors of session-to-session symptom improvement across the first five therapy sessions. Two elements of therapist adherence (viz., cognitive methods and negotiating content/structuring sessions) emerged as the strongest predictors of symptom improvement. Patient facilitation or inhibition of therapist adherence also predicted subsequent symptom change. Neither adherence to behavioral methods/homework nor the therapeutic alliance was a significant predictor in parallel analyses. Although alliance scores did not predict subsequent symptom change, they were significantly predicted by prior symptom change. These findings support the model of change that motivates cognitive therapy for depression, and they highlight the potential role of patient facilitation of therapists' adherence in treatment response.",2010-Jul,Behaviour research and therapy,Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Randomized Controlled Trial,2010,YES,sa,Which therapist techniques were most predictive of session-to-session symptom improvement in cognitive therapy for moderate to severe depression?,Cognitive methods and negotiating content/structuring sessions.,The abstract states these two therapist adherence elements were the strongest predictors of symptom improvement across the first five therapy sessions in cognitive therapy for depression.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life and exercise capacity. From November 2007 to October 2009 a total of 767 patients (352 female, 14-67 years) with various congenital heart diseases (37 palliated/native cyanotic, 57 Fontan, 74 Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) after atrial switch, 50 other TGA, 136 Fallot, 38 Ebstein, 47 Pulmonic stenosis/regurgitation, 68 aortic coarctation, 103 aortic stenosis, 90 isolated shunts, 67 other) completed the health-related quality of life questionnaire SF-36 and the German translation of the ""Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale"" (CES-D) to assess depressive symptoms. Afterwards a cardiopulmonary exercise test was performed. Only 66 patients (8.6%) showed depressive symptoms fulfilling the CES-D definition for depression. The total prevalence of depression was lower than in the general population (Wilcoxon test, p<0.001) and did not differ substantially in between the diagnostic subgroups (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.195).

The institutional review board reviewed and approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from 143 consecutive women scheduled for breast CNB. Women were randomized as follows: no anxiety intervention (usual care group), relaxation therapy with an audiotape of classical music and ocean sounds during CNB (relaxation group), and 0.5-mg of alprazolam administered orally 15 minutes before CNB (medication group). Anxiety before, during, and 24 hours after the procedure was assessed with State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and self-reported visual analog scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 10 (worst anxiety). Data analysis was performed with statistical software. Descriptive statistics were computed for all variables. Group differences were determined with analysis of variance. Differences in mean values were assessed with Bonferroni multiple comparison procedure. Categorical demographic differences were assessed with chi(2) statistic. Preprocedural State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores indicated that women were not inherently anxious: usual care group, score of 44.63; relaxation group, 45.74; and medication group, 49.1. Scores represented significantly elevated anxiety for women in all three groups when compared with the normative value of 35.12 (P < .0001), with no statistically significant differences between the scores of the three groups. Women in medication group reported significant reductions in anxiety (-44%) from levels determined before the procedure to levels determined during the procedure (P = .02) and significant reduction during the procedure when compared with changes in usual care (+15%) and relaxation (-8%) groups (P = .02).

Nevertheless, new approaches to this complex phenotype are necessary to clarify the risk conferred by this gene, either to the disorder or to its clinical manifestations. The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of a genetic polymorphism of the promoter region of the IL-1beta gene, in schizophrenia defined with: (i) a categorical diagnosis and (ii) a multidimensional symptom approach. We studied 356 individuals from 89 nuclear families consisting of one affected individual and the unaffected father, mother, and sib, in a family-based association study design. We find a trend for biased transmission of allele 2 from heterozygous parents to affected offspring, categorically defined (P = 0.07). This tendency was not observed in the healthy offspring.

However, baclofen induces sedation, hypothermia and muscle relaxation, which may interfere with its use in behavioral paradigms. Although there is much evidence for a role of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in the pathophysiology of anxiety, the role of GABAB receptors in these disorders is largely unclear. We recently identified GS39783 (N,N'-dicyclopentyl-2-methylsulfanyl-5-nitro-pyrimidine-4,6-diamine) as a selective allosteric positive modulator at GABAB receptors. The aim of the present study was to broadly characterize the effects of GS39783 in well-validated rodent models for motor activity, cognition, and anxiety. The following tests were included: locomotor activity in rats and mice, rotarod and traction tests (including determinations of core temperature) in mice, passive avoidance in mice and rats, elevated plus maze in rats, elevated zero maze in mice and rats, stress-induced hyperthermia in mice, and pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced sleep in mice. Unlike baclofen and/or the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, GS39783 had no effect in any of the tests for locomotion, cognition, temperature, or narcosis. Most interestingly, GS39783 had anxiolytic-like effects in all the tests used.

15120985,The association between depressive symptoms and social support in Taiwanese women during the month.,"The purpose of the study was to explore the association between depressive symptoms and social support in Taiwanese women doing the month. A correlational survey design using the Postpartum Social Support Questionnaire (PSSQ) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to measure social support and postnatal depressive symptomatology was employed. Two hundred and forty postpartum women receiving care in two teaching hospitals in Taipei, Taiwan, aged between 20 and 35, with no peri-natal complications or previous psychiatric history, experiencing a normal spontaneous delivery of one full term healthy baby, were selected. Each was mailed the PSSQ and the EPDS as well as a short, semi-structured self-report questionnaire requesting demographic details and subjective data relating to the experience of doing the month and depressive symptoms during the fourth week following birth. One hundred and eighty six women (78%) returned questionnaires. Taiwanese postpartum women were less depressed when they stayed in their parents' home and had their own mothers take care of them. It was found that the greater the level of postpartum social support received by the women doing the month, the lower the risk of postnatal depressive symptoms experienced. Almost a quarter (24%) of the variance of the symptoms was attributed to dissatisfaction with parents' instrumental support and unwanted emotional support from parents-in-law. It is concluded that the ritual of doing the month provides valuable social support and may help to prevent postnatal depression in Taiwanese women.",2004-Jul,International journal of nursing studies,Journal Article,2004,YES,sa,What specific types of familial social support are most effective in reducing postpartum depressive symptoms in Taiwanese women?,Instrumental support from their own mothers and staying in their parents' home.,"The abstract states that Taiwanese women were less depressed when their mothers provided care and they stayed in their parents' home, highlighting the importance of specific familial support types."
14706942,Modulation of cortical-limbic pathways in major depression: treatment-specific effects of cognitive behavior therapy.,"Functional imaging studies of major depressive disorder demonstrate response-specific regional changes following various modes of antidepressant treatment. To examine changes associated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Brain changes underlying response to CBT were examined using resting-state fluorine-18-labeled deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Seventeen unmedicated, unipolar depressed outpatients (mean +/- SD age, 41 +/- 9 years; mean +/- SD initial 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, 20 +/- 3) were scanned before and after a 15- to 20-session course of outpatient CBT. Whole-brain, voxel-based methods were used to assess response-specific CBT effects. A post hoc comparison to an independent group of 13 paroxetine-treated responders was also performed to interpret the specificity of identified CBT effects. A full course of CBT resulted in significant clinical improvement in the 14 study completers (mean +/- SD posttreatment Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 6.7 +/- 4). Treatment response was associated with significant metabolic changes: increases in hippocampus and dorsal cingulate (Brodmann area [BA] 24) and decreases in dorsal (BA 9/46), ventral (BA 47/11), and medial (BA 9/10/11) frontal cortex. This pattern is distinct from that seen with paroxetine-facilitated clinical recovery where prefrontal increases and hippocampal and subgenual cingulate decreases were seen. Like other antidepressant treatments, CBT seems to affect clinical recovery by modulating the functioning of specific sites in limbic and cortical regions.

Treatment of depression may or may not prove to alter depression as a risk factor, but improving the quality of life (QOL) of patients with coronary disease also should be considered a primary outcome. Quality of life is a difficult concept to define and measure. However, recent investigations in patients with coronary disease have examined the relationship of QOL to mortality risk and depression.

Of the 102 patients initially assessed, 80 (78.4%) completed the study. Most aspects of QOL did not change considerably over time. At EOT, patients reported only significant increases in fatigue and significant decreases in sleep disturbance. Although no significant changes emerged in the rates of anxiety or depression throughout chemotherapy, nearly one-third of the patients experienced severe emotional distress at both points in time. In addition, the authors observed neither significant alteration in the cognitive performance over time nor reliable associations between scores on the MMSE and subjective cognitive function, emotional distress, or QOL. Finally, depression proved to be the leading predictor of global QOL at baseline and at EOT. The results indicated that a significant proportion of Greek patients with cancer experienced intense anxiety and depression throughout chemotherapy and confirmed the importance of depression as a strong predictor of global QOL.

15252281,CB1 cannabinoid receptors mediate anxiolytic effects: convergent genetic and pharmacological evidence with CB1-specific agents.,"Cannabinoids are known to modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission in cortical areas, the former via CB1 and the latter via a novel receptor. Pharmacological data demonstrate that several widely used cannabinoid ligands bind to both receptors, which may explain the inconsistencies in their behavioural effects. Earlier we showed that the cannabinoid antagonist SR-141716A affected behaviour in both CB1 knockout and wild-type animals, and its effect (anxiolysis) was different from that of CB1 gene disruption (anxiogenesis). In the present experiments, we studied the effects of the CB1 antagonist AM-251, and the cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 in wild-type as well as in CB1 knockout mice. CB1 knockout mice showed higher scores of anxiety-like behaviour than the wild-type animals in the elevated plus-maze. Selective blockade of CB1 receptors by AM-251 (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg) increased anxiety-like behaviour dose-dependently in the wild-type mice but had no effect in the knockouts. In wild types, the cannabinoid agonist WIN-55,212-2 (1 and 3 mg/kg) caused a decrease in anxiety-like behaviour, which was abolished by the CB1-selective antagonist AM-251 (3 mg/kg). The same agonist did not change plus-maze behaviour in CB1 knockout animals. These data demonstrate at the behavioural level that AM-251 and, at low concentrations, WIN-55,212-2, are selective ligands of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in mice. Our studies on the behavioural effects of the cannabinoid antagonist SR-141716A and the CB1 antagonist AM-251 show that the CB1 and the novel cannabinoid receptor mediate anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects, respectively. This suggests that agonists of the former, or antagonists of the latter, are promising new compounds in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety.",2004-Jul,Behavioural pharmacology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2004,YES,sa,What pharmacological strategy could be considered to reduce anxiety-like behavior based on the differential roles of CB1 and the novel cannabinoid receptor?,Using CB1 agonists or antagonists of the novel cannabinoid receptor.,"The abstract shows CB1 agonists reduce anxiety-like behavior, while blocking CB1 increases it.

15363961,Adenosine A1 receptors modulate the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol in the elevated plus-maze in mice.,"The anxiolytic property of ethanol is generally accepted to be an important motivational factor for its consumption and the development of alcohol dependence. Recent studies suggest that adenosine receptors mediate important actions of ethanol, such as motor incoordination and hypnotic effects. In addition, several lines of evidence support the involvement of adenosine in anxiety. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of adenosine receptors in the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol in mice. The effects of acute administration of the adenosine receptor antagonists caffeine (nonselective), 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, adenosine A1 receptor antagonist) and 4-(2-[7-amino-2-[2-furyl][1,2,4]triazolo-[2,3-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl)phenol (ZM241385, adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist), together with the adenosine A1 receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA), and their interaction with ethanol in the elevated plus-maze test in mice were studied. The highest doses of caffeine (30.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and DPCPX (6.0 mg/kg, i.p.) produced an anxiogenic-like effect, while CCPA administration (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) showed an anxiolytic-like activity. The prior administration of ""non-anxiogenic"" doses of caffeine (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and DPCPX (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), but not ZM241385 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), significantly reduced the anxiolytic-like effect of ethanol (1.2 g/kg, i.p.). Moreover, anxiolytic-like response was observed by the co-administration of ""non-anxiolytic"" doses of CCPA (0.125 mg/kg) and ethanol (0.6 g/kg). These results reinforce the involvement of adenosine in anxiety and suggest that the activation of adenosine A1 receptors, but not adenosine A(2A) receptors, mediate the anxiolytic-like effect induced by ethanol in mice.",2004-Sep-19,European journal of pharmacology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2004,YES,sa,How might adenosine A1 receptor activation influence the anxiolytic effects of ethanol in the treatment of anxiety disorders?,Adenosine A1 receptor activation enhances the anxiolytic effects of ethanol.,"The abstract shows that adenosine A1 receptor activation via CCPA produces anxiolytic-like effects and synergizes with sub-anxiolytic ethanol doses, while A1 receptor antagonism reduces ethanol’s anxiolytic effects, highlighting A1 receptor involvement in ethanol-induced anxiolysis."

However, they have also been reported in normally developing children and in association with temporary psychological reactions to acute stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hallucinatory experiences in a nonclinical population of children and to examine the relationship between the modality and content of hallucinations and psychopathology. Seven hundred sixty-one Japanese children, 11 to 12 years old, completed a battery of four measures: (1) a questionnaire about the type of hallucinatory experience, (2) the Children's Depression Inventory, (3) the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, and (4) the Adolescent Dissociative Experiences Scale. Approximately 21% of the subjects had experienced hallucinations.

15275942,Attentional bias to threat and emotional response to biological challenge.,"Attentional bias towards threat reliably correlates with clinical anxiety status as well as elevated trait anxiety. Although such findings have led many to posit a potential causative or predictive role of threat-biased attentional processes on anxiety problems, little informative research exists. The present investigation was designed to address the role of threat-biased attentional processes on emotional/fearful responding. Eighty-seven participants provided baseline measures of anxiety vulnerability (i.e., anxiety sensitivity; unmasked/masked emotional Stroop task indices) and then underwent biological challenge procedures (inhalations of 20% carbon dioxide (CO2)-enriched air). Following challenge, participants completed measures of emotional response. Regression analyses indicated that both unmasked and masked attentional bias indices significantly predicted emotional responding above and beyond anxiety sensitivity. Exploratory analyses also revealed a gender effect, with prediction of emotional response largely attributable to females.

15194450,Behavioral and physiological mouse models for anxiety: effects of flesinoxan in 129S6/SvEvTac and C57BL/6J mice.,"Serotonin(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptors are involved in anxiety. This study focuses on the role of genetic factors on the anxiety-related effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation using both a within subject design. The effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation were studied in high- and low-anxiety mice (129S6/SvEvTac (S6) and C57BL/6J (B6), respectively) in behavioral and physiological anxiety-related assays. These two strains were also selected because they are frequently used in gene-targeting studies. Mice were treated with the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist flesinoxan (0-0.3-1.0-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) and tested in either the open-field activity test, the light-dark exploration test, or the stress-induced hyperthermia paradigm. Flesinoxan unexpectedly increased anxiety, but also decreased activity on several behavioral measures in B6 mice. Flesinoxan produced only minimal effects in the behavioral tests in the high-anxiety S6 strain. In contrast, the physiological hyperthermia response showed anxiolytic-like effects of flesinoxan in both strains. Our data indicate that the role of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation on anxiety-related responses is dependent on genetic background and selected paradigm used to assess anxiety. These findings indicate that it is critical to use a multi-level approach to develop mouse models for human diseases. In addition, the implication of such findings for studies on genetically modified mice is discussed.",2004-Jun-21,European journal of pharmacology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2004,YES,sa,How might genetic background influence the anxiolytic or anxiogenic effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists in anxiety disorders?,"Genetic background can modulate the effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists, with certain genotypes showing anxiogenic effects (e.g., C57BL/6J) and others showing minimal behavioral response (e.g., 129S6/SvEvTac).","The abstract highlights that the anxiety-related effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists vary by genetic background, as behavioral responses differed between the two mouse strains tested, emphasizing the importance of genetics in therapeutic outcomes."

14978780,Does elimination of placebo responders in a placebo run-in increase the treatment effect in randomized clinical trials? A meta-analytic evaluation.,"The use of a placebo run-in phase, in which placebo responders are withdrawn from a study before random assignment to treatment condition, has been criticized as favoring the active treatment in clinical trials. We compared the effect size of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (in the treatment of depression with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]) that include a placebo run-in phase with those that do not, using a meta-analytic approach. This study differed from earlier meta-analytic studies in that it considered only SSRIs and included only studies using continuous measures of depression, allowing for a more refined assessment of effect size. An extensive literature search identified 43 datasets published between 1980 and 2000 comparing placebo with SSRI and using a continuous measure of depression (usually the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). We included only studies of at least 6 weeks' duration focusing on treatment for primary acute major depression in adults 18-65 years of age. Studies focusing on depression in specific medical illnesses were not included. Analysis of efficacy was based on 3047 subjects treated with an SSRI antidepressant and 3740 subjects treated with a placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in effect size between the clinical trials that had a placebo run-in phase followed by withdrawal of placebo responders and those trials that did not. Despite the lack of a statistically significant difference between studies of withdrawing early placebo responders and those not using this procedure, this approach is likely to continue to be used widely because it produces large absolute effect sizes.

Major and minor depression were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria, sub-clinical depression was defined as a GDS score >10 while not meeting the DSM-V criteria for depression. The prevalence of major depression was assessed to be 8.1% and the prevalence of minor depression was 14.1%, while a further 24% of the patients suffered from sub-clinical depression. For major depression significant risk indicators were found for pain, functional limitations, visual impairment, stroke, loneliness, lack of social support, negative life events and perceived inadequacy of care. For sub-clinical depression the same risk indicators were found, with the exception of lack of social support. Data were collected cross-sectional. The prevalence of depression in the nursing home population is very high. Whichever way defined, the prevalence rates found were three to four times higher than in the community-dwelling elderly. Age, pain, visual impairment, stroke, functional limitations, negative life events, loneliness, lack of social support and perceived inadequacy of care were found to be risk indicators for depression. Consequently, optimal physical treatment and special attention and focus on psychosocial factors must be major goals in developing care programs for this frail population.",2004-Dec,Journal of affective disorders,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2004,YES,sa,"What are two psychosocial risk indicators for major depression in nursing home patients, and how might these differ for sub-clinical depression?",Loneliness and lack of social support are risk indicators for major depression.

Sub-clinical depression shares loneliness but excludes lack of social support.
15489855,Genetic dissection of a behavioral quantitative trait locus shows that Rgs2 modulates anxiety in mice.,"Here we present a strategy to determine the genetic basis of variance in complex phenotypes that arise from natural, as opposed to induced, genetic variation in mice. We show that a commercially available strain of outbred mice, MF1, can be treated as an ultrafine mosaic of standard inbred strains and accordingly used to dissect a known quantitative trait locus influencing anxiety. We also show that this locus can be subdivided into three regions, one of which contains Rgs2, which encodes a regulator of G protein signaling. We then use quantitative complementation to show that Rgs2 is a quantitative trait gene. This combined genetic and functional approach should be applicable to the analysis of any quantitative trait.",2004-Nov,Nature genetics,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2004,YES,sa,"What genetic mechanism could potentially explain individual variability in anxiety traits, and how might this inform treatment strategies?","Variation in the Rgs2 gene, which regulates G protein signaling, could underlie differences in anxiety traits, guiding targeted interventions.",The abstract identifies Rgs2 as a quantitative trait gene influencing anxiety.

15179906,Personal resources and depression in the transition to adulthood: ethnic comparisons.,"Based on a representative sample of 1,803 South Florida young adults, we examine the extent to which personal attributes mediate or moderate the ethnicity-depression relationship and condition the effects of social stress on depression. Our sample contains nearly equal proportions of African American, Cuban American, ""other"" Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white respondents. Findings suggest that there are ethnic variations in four of the five personal resources considered. Additionally, when accounting for ethnic differences in response tendencies and in the confounding of personal resources with depression, there is strong evidence for both direct and stress-buffering effects of personal resources. Although naïve comparisons of within group findings imply a number of ethnic variations in those effects, few statistically significant differences are observed. It is suggested that ethnic similarities outweigh differences, at least with respect to the mental health significance of the personal resources considered. Overall, the results highlight some of the complexities inherent in making multi-ethnic comparisons.",2004-Mar,Journal of health and social behavior,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2004,YES,sa,How might personal resources influence the relationship between social stress and depression in a multi-ethnic population?,"Personal resources can have both direct effects on depression and stress-buffering effects, reducing the impact of social stress on depression.","The abstract states that personal resources exhibit both direct and stress-buffering effects on depression, and while ethnic variations exist, similarities in their mental health significance across ethnic groups are more prominent."

15099616,Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Spanish version of the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia.,"The Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) is a valid tool to assess depression in schizophrenics and has been translated, adapted, and validated to be used in different non-English languages. Therefore, it may be predicted that a Spanish version of this scale will be also a valid instrument to assess symptoms of depression in patients with schizophrenia. We determined the validity of the Spanish version of the Calgary scale (CDSS-S). Outpatients and inpatients (n=93) diagnosed as having schizophrenia by DSM-IV criteria confirmed by SCID-IV interview were included. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17 and HDRS-21 items), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (ESRS), and Barnes Acathisia Rating Scale were administered by a first rater, whereas the CDSS-S was assessed by a second independent rater. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.83) and the interrater reliability (>0.73 intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] for single items and 0.92 for total score) were good. The test-retest reliability was high (ICC of 0.89). The scale showed a good construct validity with statistically significant correlations with HDRS-17, HDRS-21, MADRS, and G6 item (depression) of PANSS. The CDSS showed no correlation with the positive subscale of PANSS and a weak correlation with the negative subscale, general psychopathology subscale, and total score of PANSS. A cut point of five showed 94.7% sensitivity, 86.5% specificity, and 70% and 98% positive and negative predictive values, respectively.

15184333,Family caregiver burden: results of a longitudinal study of breast cancer patients and their principal caregivers.,"The vital role played by family caregivers in supporting dying cancer patients is well recognized, but the burden and economic impact on caregivers is poorly understood. We prospectively examined the psychosocial, occupational and economic impact of caring for a person with a terminal illness. We studied 89 caregivers of women with advanced breast cancer receiving care at either the Ottawa or Hamilton regional cancer centres in Ontario. Patients were followed until their death or study completion at 3 years. Patients identified a principal caregiver to participate in the study. The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) index, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Zarit Burden Inventory, FAMCARE and the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey were administered during follow-up. Economic data were collected by means of a questionnaire administered by an interviewer. Assessments were conducted every 3 months during the palliative period (KPS score > 50) and every 2 weeks during the terminal period (KPS score < or = 50). Over half of the caregivers were male (55%) and the patient's spouse or partner (52%), with a mean age of 53 years. At the start of the palliative period, the caregivers' mean physical functioning score was better than the patients' (51.3 v. 35.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.3-20.0); there were similar mean mental functioning scores (46.6 and 47.1 respectively); similar proportions were depressed (11% and 12%); and significantly more caregivers than patients were anxious (35% v. 19%, p = 0.009). More caregivers were depressed (30% v. 9%, p = 0.02) and had a higher level of perceived burden (26.2 v. 19.4, p = 0.02) at the start of the terminal period than at the start of the palliative period. Burden was the most important predictor of both anxiety and depression. Of employed caregivers, 69% reported some form of adverse impact on work. In the terminal period 77% reported missing work because of caregiving responsibilities. Prescription drugs were the most important component of financial burden.

15205971,Does psychiatric comorbidity in alcohol-dependent patients affect treatment outcome?,"Comorbidity in alcohol research refers to the presence of alcohol dependency and another major psychiatric disorder. The existence of additional disorders may have consequences for treatment planning and success. The aims of this paper are therefore: 1) to give an overview on prevalence rates in studies with representative cohorts and hospital-based samples; 2) to report results on gender differences and 3) to determine the impact of comorbidity on treatment outcome. Comorbidity was examined with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) in N = 118 (61 male and 57 female) alcohol-dependent patients who were socially well integrated. Results show that 65% of the female patients but only 28% of the male patients had a lifetime history of additional psychiatric disorders. Significantly more phobic/anxiety disorders, mood disorders occur in female patients. One year after inpatient treatment, overall 39% had suffered a relapse. More detailed analysis revealed that 55% of the non-comorbid but only 28% of the comorbid women suffered a relapse, thus contradicting our initial hypothesis that comorbid patients have a poorer prognosis with regard to their alcohol dependence.

15951099,"Histories of depression, allopregnanolone responses to stress, and premenstrual symptoms in women.","Twenty-six women meeting DSM criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and 39 non-PMDD controls were tested for allopregnanolone (ALLO) responses to mental stress. Approximately half of each group had a history of depression (DEP) (14 PMDD, 17 non-PMDD), though all were free of current psychiatric illness. ALLO was sampled in response to venipuncture stress, after an extended baseline, and again 30 and 60 min following the onset of mental stressors. All women with prior DEP, regardless of PMDD status, showed a blunted ALLO stress response at 30 and 60 min (p < 0.05), and also failed to show the expected decrease from venipuncture to baseline rest (p = 0.08) compared to women with no prior DEP. Women with prior DEP did not show the expected correlation between progesterone and ALLO (r = 0.16) that was seen in those with no prior DEP (r = 0.37, p < 0.05). ALLO levels at extended baseline and blunted ALLO reactivity predicted more severe premenstrual symptoms, but only in PMDD women with prior DEP (p values <0.05). These results suggest that a history of DEP is associated with a failure of ALLO to be appropriately responsive to challenge, with alterations in the conversion of progesterone to ALLO, and confirm prior reports linking ALLO to symptoms in PMDD, but only in PMDD women with histories of DEP.",2006-Jan,Biological psychology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",2005,YES,sa,How does a history of depression affect allopregnanolone (ALLO) reactivity to stress in women with PMDD?,"It leads to blunted ALLO stress responses and altered progesterone-to-ALLO conversion, predicting more severe premenstrual symptoms in PMDD women.","The abstract states that prior depression blunts ALLO reactivity, disrupts progesterone-ALLO correlation, and exacerbates PMDD symptoms, highlighting the interaction between depression history and ALLO dysregulation."

Its validity as an index of severity of depression was also good as well as internal consistency and reliability. Factor analysis showed that its internal structure is composed of two subscales (F2 ""depression"" and F1 with items reflecting depression and other disorders, including anxiety).

16165300,Chronic stress impairs acoustic conditioning more than visual conditioning in rats: morphological and behavioural evidence.,"Chronic stress affects brain areas involved in learning and emotional responses. These alterations have been related with the development of cognitive deficits in major depression. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic immobilization stress on the auditory and visual mesencephalic regions in the rat brain. We analyzed in Golgi preparations whether stress impairs the neuronal morphology of the inferior (auditory processing) and superior colliculi (visual processing). Afterward, we examined the effect of stress on acoustic and visual conditioning using an avoidance conditioning test. We found that stress induced dendritic atrophy in inferior colliculus neurons and did not affect neuronal morphology in the superior colliculus. Furthermore, stressed rats showed a stronger impairment in acoustic conditioning than in visual conditioning. Fifteen days post-stress the inferior colliculus neurons completely restored their dendritic structure, showing a high level of neural plasticity that is correlated with an improvement in acoustic learning. These results suggest that chronic stress has more deleterious effects in the subcortical auditory system than in the visual system and may affect the aversive system and fear-like behaviors.

15719214,Prefrontal TMS produces smaller EEG responses than motor-cortex TMS: implications for rTMS treatment in depression.,"The stimulus intensity of prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) during depression treatment is usually determined by adjusting it with respect to the motor threshold (MT). There is some evidence that reactivity of the prefrontal cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is lower than that of the motor cortex at MT stimulation. However, it is unknown whether this is true when other stimulus intensities are used. We investigated whether the magnitude and shape of the overall TMS-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) responses differ between prefrontal and motor cortices. Magnetic pulses to the left motor and prefrontal cortices (the middle frontal gyrus identified from magnetic resonance images) were delivered at four intensities (60, 80, 100, and 120% of MT of the right abductor digiti minimi muscle) for six subjects. Simultaneously, EEG was recorded with 60 scalp electrodes. Global mean-field amplitudes (GMFAs) reflecting overall cortical activity were significantly smaller after prefrontal- than after motor-cortex TMS. A significant positive correlation (r (s)=0.84, p<0.01) was found between GMFAs of motor- and prefrontal-cortex TMS across the experiments. However, when correlation between the responses of motor and prefrontal cortices was examined, significant positive correlations were found at 80 and 100% intensities only.

16176387,Common variations in the pretest environment influence genotypic comparisons in models of anxiety.,"The behavioral characterization of rodent strains in different studies and laboratories can provide unreplicable results even when genotypes are kept constant and environmental control is maximized. In the present study, the influence of common laboratory environmental variables and their interaction with genotype on the results of behavioral tests of anxiety/emotionality were investigated. To this end, the inbred rat strains Lewis (LEW) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which are known to differ for numerous emotionality-related behaviors, were tested in the open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM) and black/white box (BWB), while three environmental factors were systematically controlled and analyzed: (1) the experimenter handling the animal (familiar or unfamiliar); (2) the position of the home cage (top or bottom shelf of the rack) and (3) the behavioral state of the animal immediately before the test (arousal or rest). Experimenter familiarity did not alter the behavior of rats in the OF. Cage position, on the other hand, influenced the behavior in the OF and BWB, with rats housed in top cages appearing less anxious than those housed in the bottom. In the BWB (but not in the OF), these effects were genotype dependent. Finally, the behavioral state of the animals prior to testing altered the results of the EPM in a strain-dependent manner, with some anxiety-related genotypic differences being found only among rats that were aroused in their home cages. This study showed that common variations in the laboratory environment interact with genotype in behavioral tests of anxiety/emotionality.

Diabetes complications were the strongest predictor of total costs (6845 US dollars for those with three or more complications vs. 1719 US dollars for those with none), but depression remained strongly associated with increased costs at all levels of diabetes severity. Among people with diabetes, depression is associated with 50-75% increases in health service costs. This proportional difference is similar to that in general population samples, but the absolute dollar difference is much greater. The effect of depression on health service use is undoubtedly complex and not limited to unexplained physical symptoms among the worried well.",2005,General hospital psychiatry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2005,YES,sa,"What is the relationship between major depression and health service costs in adults with diabetes, and how does this relationship persist across varying levels of diabetes severity?","Major depression increases health service costs by 50-75%, and this association persists regardless of diabetes severity, with costs remaining elevated at all levels of complications.","The abstract states that depression is associated with a 50-75% increase in costs and remains a strong predictor of higher costs even when diabetes severity varies, highlighting its independent impact."
16285840,Depression in children and adolescents.,"During the past 20 years, depression has been recognized widely in children and adolescents. However, even with what is known today about depression, many children and adolescents remain undiagnosed. Early recognition is imperative to prevent further episodes that may continue into adulthood. Depression in children and adolescents affects social development, academic performance, and ultimately, success as an adult.

15778891,Motivational aspects of maternal anxiolysis in lactating rats.,"This study examines the role of maternal motivation on the reduced anxiety-like responses displayed by lactating rats in the plus maze test. Maternal animals, both lactating and sensitized (ovariectomized females behaving maternal after a continuous exposure to pups), displayed anxiolytic-like responses in the plus maze test in contrast to ovariectomized non-maternal rats. However, the levels of experimental anxiety were lower in lactating than in sensitized females. Pups placed in the open arms of the maze further reduced the low levels of anxiety-like behavior of both sensitized and lactating rats. Low doses of haloperidol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg), a dopamine antagonist, which interfere with maternal motivation but has neither anxiolytic nor anxiogenic effect in the plus maze test, significantly increased the anxiety-like responses of lactating rats. The presence of the pups in the open arms of the maze overrode the behavioral effect of haloperidol on lactating dams' anxiety-related behavior. These experiments show that maternity induces changes in the way the animals react to the environment, rendering them less anxious to aversive stimuli. The degree of experimental anxiolysis displayed by maternal animals varies according to their maternal motivation, which is modulated by the female's endocrine state, the pups and/or the dopaminergic system.",2005-Jul,Psychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2005,YES,sa,"How might a dopamine antagonist like haloperidol influence anxiety-related behavior in lactating individuals, and what environmental factor could mitigate this effect?","Haloperidol increases anxiety-like behavior in lactating individuals, but the presence of offspring mitigates this effect.","Haloperidol interferes with maternal motivation, increasing anxiety-like responses in lactating rats. However, the presence of pups in the environment overrides haloperidol's anxiogenic effects, demonstrating the modulatory role of maternal motivation and external stimuli."
15820417,Chronic administration of the SSRI fluvoxamine markedly and selectively reduces the sensitivity of cortical serotonergic neurons to footshock stress.,"We have evaluated, with the use of vertical microdialysis, the effects of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) on the increase in serotonin and norepinephrine output elicited in rats prefrontal cortex by exposure to footshock stress. Exposure to footshock stress induced a marked increase in the cortical extracellular concentration of both serotonin and norepinephrine (+70% and +100%, respectively) in control rats. Long term, but not acute administration of fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg, i.p. once a days for 21 days) completely antagonized the stress induced increase in cortical serotonin extracellular concentration, while failed to modify the sensitivity of cortical noradrenergic neurons to the same stressful stimulus. Our results have shown that it is possible to independently modulate the sensitivity of cortical serotonergic neurons to stressful stimuli without altering the responsiveness of noradrenergic neurons to the same stress. Given the different role played by serotonin and norepinephrine in the modulation of the stress response, the availability of drugs able to selectively modulate the plastic response of serotonergic neurons to stress in specific brain areas might be important for the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders.",2005-May,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,2005,YES,sa,How might long-term administration of fluvoxamine affect the serotonergic and noradrenergic responses to acute stress in the prefrontal cortex?,Fluvoxamine reduces serotonergic response to stress but does not affect the noradrenergic response.,"The abstract shows long-term fluvoxamine use antagonizes stress-induced serotonin increases but does not alter norepinephrine responses, suggesting selective modulation of serotonergic neurons without affecting noradrenergic sensitivity."
16276848,Unmet need for the treatment of depression in Atlantic Canada.,"Most people with depression do not receive treatment, even though effective interventions are available. Population-based data can assist health service planners to improve access to mental health services. This study aimed to examine the determinants of untreated depression in Canada's Atlantic provinces. This study used data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.1. Logistic regression models explored the prevalence of depression and associated patterns of mental health service use among population subgroups. Of the respondents, 7.3% experienced major depression in the previous year, as measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Short Form. Individuals with the following characteristics were at increased risk for depression: female sex; widowed, separated, or divorced marital status; low income; and 2 or more comorbid medical conditions. Only 40% of respondents with probable depression reported any consultation about their condition with a general practitioner or mental health specialist. Less than one-quarter of Atlantic Canadians with depression reported receiving levels of care consistent with practice guidelines. Vulnerable groups, including older individuals, people with low levels of education, and those living in rural areas, were significantly less likely to receive treatment in either primary or specialty care. These findings suggest inequitable access to services and the need to target interventions to at-risk populations by raising awareness among the public and health care providers. Health systems in the Atlantic region must work toward achieving consistent longitudinal care for a larger proportion of individuals suffering from depression by studying the underlying factors for service use among underserved groups.",2005-Sep,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

At the initiation of isotretinoin treatment, week 8 review and termination of treatment, patients completed validated measures of depression, hopelessness and self-rated dermatological severity and were also assessed dermatologically using an acne grading protocol. When the first phase of isotretinoin treatment (week 1 to week 8) was compared to the second phase (week 9 to week 16), patients reported significant improvements in the cognitive-affective features of depression during the first phase of treatment, but not during the second phase.

16420086,Long-term weight gain in patients treated with open-label olanzapine in combination with fluoxetine for major depressive disorder.,"Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with olanzapine in combination with fluoxetine (OFC) demonstrate robust improvement in their depressive symptoms. Treatment with olanzapine may impact a patient's weight; thus, long-term weight gain and potential predictors (e.g., age and gender) and correlates (e.g., cholesterol and glucose levels) of weight gain were investigated in OFC-treated patients with MDD. Outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnostic criteria for MDD were included (N = 549) in the current analyses of this 76-week, open-label study (February 2000 to July 2002). Maximum, endpoint, and potentially clinically significant (PCS; > or = 7% increase from baseline) weight gain; time to PCS weight gain; and predictors and correlates of weight change were assessed. Patients were treated once daily with oral olanzapine (6, 12, or 18 mg) plus fluoxetine (25, 50, or 75 mg) capsules. Statistical significance for all tests was based upon p < or = .05. Mean baseline-to-endpoint weight change was 5.6 +/- 6.6 kg (12.3 +/- 14.6 lb). Weight gain plateaued by 52 weeks. Fifty-six percent of patients met criteria for PCS weight gain by 76 weeks, and the median time to PCS weight gain was 16 weeks. Low baseline body mass index (BMI), female gender, younger age, and increased fluoxetine dose were predictors of weight gain; olanzapine dose was not. Patients with early (< or = 6 weeks) rapid PCS weight gain were 4.6 times more likely to gain substantial (> or = 15%) weight long-term (weeks 7-76). Changes to endpoint in total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure values were positively correlated with weight change. Long-term (76 weeks) OFC treatment may lead to a large percentage (56%) of patients meeting criteria for PCS weight gain (> or = 7%). The risk of weight gain may be significantly increased for OFC-treated patients who have a low BMI or who are female, younger, or taking high-dose fluoxetine. It is important that prescribers balance the risk of weight gain with the benefit of treatment for individual patients with depression.",2005-Nov,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Multicenter Study,2005,YES,sa,What baseline characteristics predict a higher likelihood of clinically significant weight gain in patients treated with olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) for major depressive disorder?,"Low baseline BMI, female gender, younger age, and higher fluoxetine dose.","The abstract identifies these factors as predictors of weight gain during OFC treatment, supported by statistical analysis of patient data over 76 weeks."

15982146,Prevention and early intervention of anxiety disorders in inhibited preschool children.,"This article reports results from an early intervention program aimed at preventing the development of anxiety in preschool children. Children were selected if they exhibited a high number of withdrawn/inhibited behaviors--one of the best identified risk factors for later anxiety disorders--and were randomly allocated to either a 6-session parent-education program or no intervention. The education program was group based and especially brief to allow the potential for public health application. Children whose parents were allocated to the education condition showed a significantly greater decrease in anxiety diagnoses at 12 months relative to those whose parents received no intervention.

They administered a cross-sectional Beck Depression Inventory and sociodemographic questionnaire to students at 1 medical school, defining their outcome measure as the use of counseling services or antidepressant medication. Of an estimated 450 available student participants in the study, 322 (71.6%) completed the questionnaire. Forty-nine students (15.2%) were classified as depressed and 10 (20.4%) reported experiencing suicidal ideation during medical school, but only 13 (26.5%) of the depressed students reported treatment. The researchers observed no difference in treatment by year in school, completion of psychiatric requirement, race, or depression severity. Treatment for depression was significantly associated with older age and personal and family histories of depression.

A grounded theory approach was chosen. Twenty-two women who showed signs of depression, i.e. scored 10 or more on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), were interviewed at an average of 80 days after the delivery. The new mothers were struggling with life related to the self, the child, and the partner. They expressed feelings of loss of who they are, felt overwhelmed by the responsibility for the child, and were struggling with feelings of abandonment, worries, and breastfeeding problems. They often felt like ""bad mothers"" but they never blamed the child. Most mothers were reluctant to speak about their feelings and they assigned their depressed mood to personal weakness rather than illness. In relationship to the partner the mothers were struggling to keep their equality in the new situation and to get him involved in childcare.

16154212,Implication of 5-HT2A subtype receptors in DOI activity in the four-plates test-retest paradigm in mice.,"The four-plates test (FPT) is an animal model of anxiety which allows the detection of anxiolytic effect not only of benzodiazepines (BZDs) but also of other non-BZDs anxiolytic compounds such as antidepressants (ADs). Furthermore, DOI, a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, has been shown to exert an anxiolytic-like effect in this model. Retesting mice in animal models of anxiety (test-retest paradigm) induces an anxiogenic-like and a loss of anxiolytic-like effects in response to BZDs and ADs. On the contrary, DOI has been reported to oppose the fear potentiation induced by trial 1 in the FPT. Despite DOI is considered as one of the most selective 5-HT(2A) available, it acts as agonist at all three 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C)). The aim of this study was thus to investigate in the FPT test-retest paradigm, which 5-HT(2) receptor subtype(s) was involved in the DOI-induced effect in experienced mice. The effect of DOI (0.25-4 mg/kg) and the agonists, 5-HT(2B), BW 723C86 (1-16 mg/kg) and 5-HT(2C), RO 60-0175 (0.25-4 mg/kg) have also been studied. Then, antagonism studies were conducted combinating the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist SR 46349B, the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor antagonist SB 206553 or the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist RS 10-2221 (at the doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg) with the DOI (1 mg/kg). Our study shows that the BW 723C86 had no effect on retesting mice, whereas it exerted an anxiolytic-like effect in naive mice. By contrast to DOI, the RO 60-0175 had no effect neither in naive nor experienced mice. Furthermore, only the SR 46349B antagonized the DOI-induced anti-punishment effect.

16213595,Prepartum chronic ultramild stress increases corticosterone and estradiol levels in gestating mice: implications for postpartum depressive disorders.,"Fluctuations in steroid hormones (glucocorticoids and estradiol) levels during pregnancy and after delivery are thought to contribute to the etiology of postpartum depression. Such changes may be exacerbated by stressful events, which constitute a predisposing factor for postpartum mood disorders. In the present study, blood hormonal variations associated with prepartum Chronic Ultramild Stress (CUMS) exposure were assessed at two times (15th day of pregnancy and 3rd day postpartum) in mice stressed from day 1 of pregnancy to termination of pregnancy. Litter weight and litter size were determined in both groups whereas the duration of pregnancy was determined in the 3-day postpartum group. CUMS increased estradiol and corticosterone levels during pregnancy, but such effects were no longer observed in the postpartum period, where cortisol levels were decreased in control and stressed mice and estradiol levels were reduced in previously stressed mothers. No effects of the CUMS procedure were observed on gestational parameters. Given the link between hormonal variations during pregnancy and subsequent postpartum depression, these results suggest that CUMS applied to gestating female may provide a useful model for the study of the mechanisms of stress, which may lead to postpartum mood disorders.",2005-Nov-15,Psychiatry research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2005,YES,sa,How might chronic mild stress during pregnancy influence hormonal changes relevant to postpartum depression risk?,"Chronic mild stress during pregnancy increases estradiol and corticosterone levels, which normalize postpartum, while estradiol levels decrease in previously stressed mothers.","The abstract links hormonal fluctuations, particularly estradiol and corticosterone changes during pregnancy and postpartum, to stress as a potential contributor to postpartum depression mechanisms."

Two hundred six MUS patients averaged 13.6 visits in the year preceding study, 79.1% were females, and the average age was 47.7 years. We found that 124 patients (60.2%) had a nonsomatoform (""psychiatric"") DSM-IV diagnosis of any type; 36 (17.5%) had 2 full nonsomatoform diagnoses, and 41 (19.9%) had >2; 92 (44.7%) had some full anxiety diagnosis and 94 (45.6%) had either full depression or minor depression diagnoses. However, only 9 of 206 (4.4%) had any full DSM-IV somatoform diagnosis, and only 39 (18.9%) had abridged somatization disorder. Thus, 48 (23.3%) were ""DSM somatoform-positive"" and 158 (76.7%) were ""DSM somatoform-negative."" The latter exhibited less anxiety, depression, mental dysfunction, and psychosomatic symptoms (all p <.001) and less physical dysfunction (p = .011). Correlates of this DSM somatoform-negative status were female gender (p = .007), less severe mental (p = .007), and physical dysfunction (p = .004), a decreased proportion of MUS (p <.10), and less psychiatric comorbidity (p <.10); c-statistic = 0.77. We concluded that depression and anxiety characterized MUS patients better than the somatoform disorders. Our data suggested radically revising the somatoform disorders for DSM-V by incorporating a new, very large group of now-overlooked DSM somatoform-negative patients who were typically women with less severe dysfunction.",2005,Psychosomatic medicine,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2005,YES,sa,"What psychiatric diagnoses are more prevalent than DSM-IV somatoform disorders in patients with medically unexplained symptoms, and how might this influence diagnostic approaches?",Anxiety (44.7%) and depression (45.6%) are more prevalent; they better characterize MUS patients than somatoform disorders.,"The abstract shows anxiety and depression are more common than somatoform diagnoses in MUS patients.

15766293,Weight changes in postpartum women with remitted depression.,"To compare weight loss after birth in women who took the antidepressants nortriptyline or sertraline or placebo in 2 clinical studies designed to prevent recurrent postpartum major depression. Data were collected from 1995 to 2001. All subjects had at least 1 prior episode of Research Diagnostic Criteria- or DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder. Data on weight were available for 467 weeks from 60 women who were weighed 8 times from 2 to 17 weeks postpartum. The dependent measures were weight at weeks 11 and 17 and weight change from weeks 2 to 17 postpartum. At week 17, the women's weights ranged from 109 to 268 lb. Their weight change ranged from +14 to -19 lb over the 15-week postpartum period (mean = -1.8, SD = 5.1 lb). After controlling for week 2 weights, the mean weights at week 17 for the women treated with nortriptyline, sertraline, or placebo were not significantly different. Of 60 women with 3 or more weight assessments, those who were randomly assigned to nortriptyline lost weight more rapidly than the other 2 groups; however, the mean weight change across all groups was only -1.8 lb (SD = 5.1 lb). Weight loss was not compromised by antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

16223656,A multivariate score objectively assessed health of depressed elderly.,"The self-report health measures commonly used may be biased in depressed persons. We introduce a method to assess physical health objectively in prospective studies of elderly persons. Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses in the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort. Under the assumption that good health is related to survival, all baseline variables independently associated with mortality were included in a global health index. A multivariate score function for this index was derived from a Cox proportional hazard model. Information on risk factors, disabilities, medical conditions, and physiologic measurements was combined into one score. This made it possible to compare the health of persons with depression to those with other diseases. Physical health of persons with depression and stroke was equally poor. Furthermore, in persons with established depression, worse health was related to more severe symptoms. Finally, we found that the association between an inflammation marker and depression is modified by health status as measured by our index. Late-life depression is strongly associated with poor health as measured by an objective global health index. The index makes it possible to quantify health and to study potential etiological risk factors for depression in health strata.",2005-Nov,Journal of clinical epidemiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2005,YES,sa,How does the severity of depressive symptoms correlate with physical health in elderly individuals with established depression?,More severe depressive symptoms are associated with worse physical health.,"The abstract states that in individuals with established depression, worse physical health is related to more severe depressive symptoms, highlighting a direct correlation between symptom severity and health status."
16083512,Usefulness of five-item and three-item Mental Health Inventories to screen for depressive symptoms in the general population of Japan.,"The five-question Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) is a brief questionnaire that can be used to screen for depressive symptoms. Removing the 2 anxiety-related items from the MHI-5 yields the MHI-3. We assessed the performance of the Japanese versions of the MHI-5 and MHI-3 in detecting depressive symptoms in the general population of Japan. From the population of Japan, 4500 people 16 years old or older were selected by stratified-random sampling. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36, which includes the MHI-5) and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) were included in a self-administered questionnaire. ZSDS scores of 48 and above were taken to indicate the presence of moderate or severe depressive symptoms, and scores of 56 and above were taken to indicate the presence of severe depressive symptoms. We computed the correlation coefficient between the ZSDS score and the scores on the MHI-5 and MHI-3. We also computed the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Of the 3107 subjects (69% of the 4500 initially selected), 14.0% had moderate or severe depressive symptoms, and 2.0% had severe depressive symptoms as measured with the ZSDS. The correlations of ZSDS scores with MHI-5 scores and with MHI-3 scores were similar: -0.63 and -0.61, respectively. These correlation coefficients were almost the same whether or not the data were stratified by age and sex. For detecting severe depressive symptoms with the MHI-5, the area under the ROC curve was 0.942 (95%CI: 0.919 - 0.965); for the MHI-3, it was 0.933 (95%CI: 0.904 - 0.962). The MHI-5 and MHI-3 scores were correlated with the ZSDS score, and can be used to identify people with depressive symptoms in the general population of Japan.",2005-Aug-08,Health and quality of life outcomes,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,2005,YES,sa,What is the correlation between the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) scores and the MHI-3 scores in detecting depressive symptoms in the general population of Japan?,-0.61,"The abstract states that the correlation coefficient between ZSDS scores and MHI-3 scores was -0.61, indicating a strong inverse relationship in detecting depressive symptoms."

16029084,Effects of age on symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of retired police officers.,"This study addressed the effects of age on anxiety and depressive symptoms. The analysis was based on the responses of 1,334 retired male Scottish police officers (34-94 years old) to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the partialed linear and curvilinear effects of symptoms of, separately, anxiety and depression on age and retirement variables. Significant partialed effects of retirement type and present age were found. Early retirement was a vulnerability factor for both disorders. The authors found a consistent linear reduction in anxiety across age and a U-shaped function for depression across age. The differing profiles and independent effects of age on anxiety and depression are consistent with their status as separate entities. Respondents were increasingly susceptible to depression from the mid-50s onward, whereas susceptibility to anxiety was reduced with age.",2005-Jun,Psychology and aging,Journal Article,2005,YES,sa,How might early retirement influence the risk of developing anxiety and depression in older adults?,Early retirement increases vulnerability to both anxiety and depression.,"The abstract identifies early retirement as a vulnerability factor for both disorders, with depression susceptibility rising from the mid-50s onward and anxiety susceptibility decreasing with age."

Project Improving Mood, Promoting Access to Collaborative Treatment for late-life depression (IMPACT) is a multisite, randomized controlled trial comparing a primary care-based collaborative disease management program for late-life depression with care as usual. A total of 450 primary care physicians at 18 participating clinics participated in a satisfaction survey before and 12 months after IMPACT initiation. The preintervention survey focused on physicians' satisfaction with current mental health resources and ability to provide depression care. The postintervention survey repeated these and added questions about physician's experience with the IMPACT collaborative care model. Before intervention, about half (54%) of the participating physicians were satisfied with resources to treat patients with depression. After intervention, more than 90% reported the intervention as helpful in treating patients with depression and 82% felt that the intervention improved patients' clinical outcomes. Participating physicians identified proactive patient follow-up and patient education as the most helpful components of the IMPACT model. Physicians perceived a substantial need for improving depression treatment in primary care. They were very satisfied with the IMPACT collaborative care model for treating depressed older adults and felt that similar care management models would also be helpful for treating other chronic medical illnesses.",2005,General hospital psychiatry,"Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2005,YES,sa,What specific components of a collaborative care model for late-life depression are most valued by primary care physicians for improving patient outcomes?,Proactive patient follow-up and patient education.,The abstract highlights that primary care physicians identified proactive patient follow-up and patient education as the most helpful components of the IMPACT collaborative care model for improving depression treatment outcomes.
16224205,Depressive and anxiety disorder comorbidity in obsessive compulsive disorder.,"Depressive and other anxiety disorders are commonly found to coexist with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Although western studies have looked at this issue, there are no reports from India investigating anxiety and depressive comorbidity in adult OCD. Between January and December 2001, charts of 218 OCD patients seen in the OCD clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore, were evaluated using the OPCRIT criteria for ICD-10 for the presence of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders. There were 146 males and 72 females; their mean age at OCD onset was 21.32 +/- 0.64 years. Thirty-six (16.5%) patients had depressive episodes, 12 (5.5%) dysthymia and 15 (6.9%) any anxiety disorder. No significant difference in terms of age, sex, marital status or age at onset was found between the OCD patients with and without comorbid anxiety disorder, major depression or dysthymia, except that female OCD patients were more likely than males to have comorbid major depressive disorder. The results of our study are in keeping with previous data from other parts of the world, though the actual rates of comorbidity in our sample appear to be much lower. It remains to be seen whether the differences in rates are a result of methodological issues or different characteristics of sample populations. Further long-term, prospective, methodologically sound studies investigating the comorbidity of depressive and other anxiety disorders in OCD patients are needed to clarify this issue.",2005,Psychopathology,Journal Article,2005,YES,sa,"In adult OCD patients, which gender is more likely to have comorbid major depressive disorder?",Female OCD patients.,"The abstract states that female OCD patients are more likely than males to have comorbid major depressive disorder, despite no significant differences in other demographic factors."
16140127,Depression in the older adult.,"Older adults who visit the primary care physician's office often exhibit depressive symptoms. The challenge for the physician and other office staff is to determine what these symptoms mean: Loneliness? Fear? Grief? A consequence of a coexisting medical condition? A DSM depressive disorder? Or something else? Addressing ambiguous symptoms that may represent a depressive disorder may be difficult in the busy office setting. The findings of one recent study suggest that it is not lack of knowledge that impedes the recognition of depression but rather the conditions under which clinical decision making occurs. The process of ruling out medical diagnoses and opening the door to consider a mental health diagnosis can be time-consuming and circuitous, especially if the clinician is not already familiar with the patient or if the clinician who is familiar with the patient perceives insufficient time to deal with the issues raised by opening the door. The fundamental challenge for the primary care clinician as aging baby boomers inundate the health care system is to restructure office practice to recognize, assess, and manage geriatric syndromes including depression. The underlying principle for successful restructuring is acknowledging that these syndromes have multiple causes requiring multifaceted interventions. Operationally, doing simple things consistently and well may have significant impact. By consistently recognizing biologic and psychosocial risk factors for depression, by taking a careful history (including the two-question screen), and by conducting a thorough physical examination, the office-based clinician will generally have a strong clinical hunch about the presence or absence of a depressive disorder and any comorbid medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. Armed with this information, additional laboratory and brain imaging studies and subsequent management strategies are straightforward.",2005-Sep,Primary care,Journal Article; Review,2005,YES,sa,What is a key operational principle for managing geriatric depression in a busy primary care setting?,Acknowledging multiple causes and implementing multifaceted interventions.,"The abstract emphasizes that successful management of geriatric depression involves recognizing its multifactorial nature and consistently applying simple, effective practices to address biological and psychosocial risk factors, ensuring thorough history-taking and physical examinations."

This study aimed to: 1) determine the prevalence of diagnosable psychiatric illnesses, and 2) describe the mental health services received and predictors of service utilization in patients with advanced cancer. This was a cross-sectional, multi-institutional study of 251 eligible patients with advanced cancer. Eligibility included: distant metastases, primary therapy failure, nonpaid caregiver, age > or =20 years, stamina for the interview, English or Spanish-speaking, and adequate cognitive ability. Trained interviewers administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) modules for Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and a detailed questionnaire regarding mental health service utilization. Overall, 12% met criteria for a major psychiatric condition and 28% had accessed a mental health intervention for a psychiatric illness since the cancer diagnosis. Seventeen percent had discussions with a mental health professional; 90% were willing to receive treatment for emotional problems. Mental health services were not accessed by 55% of patients with major psychiatric disorders. Cancer patients who had discussed psychological concerns with mental health staff (odds ratio [OR] = 19.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 8.90-41.50) and non-Hispanic white patients (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01-7.43) were more likely to receive mental health services in adjusted analysis.

15876242,Improving patient access and choice: Assisted Bibliotherapy for mild to moderate stress/anxiety in primary care.,"Current traditional methods of mental healthcare service delivery, based on 'specialists' providing 'outpatient appointments' for formal therapy, are often inappropriate for the needs of patients in primary care. The estimated numbers of adults with mental health problems are immense, and it is this, combined with Department of Health initiatives aimed at improving choice and access, which make it essential that new ways of delivering services are explored. This trial examines the use of an assisted self-help treatment package for mild to moderate stress/anxiety [Assisted Bibliotherapy (AB)] with an adult clinical population referred by their general practitioner. Assisted Bibliotherapy is a brief intervention (8 weeks), with limited therapist contact (20-min sessions). Non-parametric statistical testing of scores from the Zung Anxiety Scale and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE) questionnaire indicated positive results. There was significant improvement at post-treatment, which was maintained at 3 month follow-up.

Participants included a sample of 103 voluntary males who were divided into two groups of unhealthy (N=55) and healthy (N=48). To assess satisfaction and negative emotions of depression, anxiety and stress among the participants, they were asked to fill out the WHOQOL-BREF and The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42). Our findings on running the hypothesized model of QOL-DASS indicated that the proposed model of QOL-DASS fitted the data well for the both healthy and unhealthy groups.

21990406,"Frequency, clinical associations, and longitudinal course of major depressive disorder in adults with cerebral glioma.","There is a need for high-quality evidence regarding the frequency, independent clinical associations, and longitudinal course of depression in patients with cerebral glioma. This was a twin-center, prospective, observational cohort study with 6-month follow-up. Consenting adults with a new diagnosis of cerebral glioma received the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition to diagnose major depressive disorder (MDD). Interviews occurred shortly after the start of radiotherapy (T1), with follow-up interviews 3 months later (T2) and 6 months later (T3). Independent associations between MDD and clinical variables were analyzed using logistic regression. One hundred fifty-five patients participated. The frequency of MDD was 13.5% ± 5.4% at T1 (n = 155); 14.8% ± 6.7% at T2 (n = 108); and 6.8% ± 5.3% at T3 (n = 88). Overall, 32 individuals were diagnosed with MDD during the study period (20.6% ± 6.4%). Inter-rater diagnostic agreement for MDD was good (κ = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.00). Independent predictors of MDD were functional impairment (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 10.8) and a previous history of depression (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 0.99 to 7.3). MDD persisted for at least 3 months in half of the patients with adequate follow-up, but many depressed patients also dropped out of the study as a result of clinical deterioration.

Various studies indicate depressive symptoms may predate clinical AD and represent a risk factor and/or prodrome of incipient dementia, but their relevance for AD offspring remains uncertain. As part of a longitudinal family study of AD, we assessed depressive symptomatology in 30 middle aged AD offspring (mean age at baseline: 41.2). Their mean total scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale increased from 1.8 to 5.3 (P < .001) across a 20-year interval.

21849983,Reversible gating of endocannabinoid plasticity in the amygdala by chronic stress: a potential role for monoacylglycerol lipase inhibition in the prevention of stress-induced behavioral adaptation.,"Chronic stress is the primary environmental risk factor for the development and exacerbation of affective disorders, thus understanding the neuroadaptations that occur in response to stress is a critical step in the development of novel therapeutics for depressive and anxiety disorders. Brain endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling is known to modulate emotional behavior and stress responses, and levels of the eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are elevated in response to chronic homotypic stress exposure. However, the role of 2-AG in the synaptic and behavioral adaptations to chronic stress is poorly understood. Here, we show that stress-induced development of anxiety-like behavior is paralleled by a transient appearance of low-frequency stimulation-induced, 2-AG-mediated long-term depression at GABAergic synapses in the basolateral amygdala, a key region involved in motivation, affective regulation, and emotional learning. This enhancement of 2-AG signaling is mediated, in part, via downregulation of the primary 2-AG-degrading enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Acute in vivo inhibition of MAGL had little effect on anxiety-related behaviors. However, chronic stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and emergence of long-term depression of GABAergic transmission was prevented by chronic MAGL inhibition, likely via an occlusive mechanism. These data indicate that chronic stress reversibly gates eCB synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses in the amygdala, and in vivo augmentation of 2-AG levels prevents both behavioral and synaptic adaptations to chronic stress.",2011-Dec,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,What role does the enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) play in the development of anxiety-like behavior under chronic stress conditions?,"MAGL downregulation enhances 2-AG signaling, facilitating synaptic plasticity changes and anxiety-like behavior.","The abstract states that MAGL downregulation increases 2-AG levels, enabling stress-induced long-term depression at GABAergic synapses in the amygdala, which parallels anxiety-like behavior development."

Different brain areas and neuronal populations most likely mediate these different behavioral effects. We used c-Fos immunohistochemistry as an indirect way to study neuronal activation or inhibition induced by DZ at anxiolytic and sedative doses (0.5 and 5mg/kg, respectively) in various brain areas involved in anxiety, arousal, sedation and addiction in C57BL/6J mice. We also focused on the two neuronal populations, orexinergic and dopaminergic neuronal populations, with the help of double-immunohistochemistry using c-Fos and orexin-A antibodies and c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase antibodies. We found that different brain areas of unhabituated mice reacted differently to the mild stress induced by vehicle injection. Also the response to anxiolytic or sedative doses of DZ differed between the areas, suggesting that distinct brain areas mediate the behavioral effects of low and high DZ doses. Our findings propose a role for inhibition of orexin neurons in the anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects of DZ. In addition, the activation of central amygdala neurons by DZ treatment was associated with anxiolytic and sedative effects. On the other hand, the ventral hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, ventral tegmental area and prefrontal cortex were sensitive even to the mild injection stress, but not to the anxiolytic dose of DZ.",2012-Mar,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,Which neuronal population's inhibition is implicated in the anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects of diazepam?,Orexin neurons.,"The abstract identifies inhibition of orexin neurons as contributing to the anxiolytic and sleep-promoting effects of diazepam, based on c-Fos immunohistochemistry findings at anxiolytic and sedative doses."
21529705,Association of polymorphisms in HCN4 with mood disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder.,"Hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) potassium channels are implicated in the control of neuronal excitability and are expressed widely in the brain. HCN4 is expressed in brain regions relevant to mood and anxiety disorders including specific thalamic nuclei, the basolateral amygdala, and the midbrain dopamine system. We therefore examined the association of HCN4 with a group of mood and anxiety disorders. We genotyped nine tag SNPs in the HCN4 gene using Sequenom iPLEX Gold technology in 285 Caucasian patients with DSM-IV mood disorders and/or obsessive compulsive disorder and 384 Caucasian controls. HCN4 polymorphisms were analyzed using single marker and haplotype-based association methods. Three SNPs showed nominal association in our population (rs12905211, rs3859014, rs498005). SNP rs12905211 maintained significance after Bonferroni correction, with allele T and haplotype CTC overrepresented in cases.

This study aimed to determine the effect of DCS (100 mg) and VPA (400 mg) on the facilitation of the extinction and acquisition of fear-conditioned memory in humans. We performed a randomized, blind, placebo-controlled, four-arm clinical trial in 60 healthy adults. Visual cues and electric shocks were used as the conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US), respectively. The extinction or acquisition effect was not observed in the simple recall after the extinction or acquisition of coupled CS-US; however, the extinction and habituation effects but not the acquisition effects were presented after the unexpected re-exposure of coupled CS-US (reinstatement stimuli). Extinction and habituation effects were facilitated by either a single dose of DCS or VPA or a combination of DCS and VPA. However, we did not observe the expected synergistic effect of the combined treatment on the extinction or habituation of fear conditioning. A single dose of DCS or VPA might enhance exposure-based cognitive therapy of anxiety disorders by reducing the vulnerability to reinstatement and preventing relapses of fear-conditioned responses.",2011-Dec,Psychopharmacology,"Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,Which pharmacological agents could potentially enhance exposure-based therapy for anxiety disorders by reducing vulnerability to fear-conditioned reinstatement?,D-cycloserine (100 mg) or valproic acid (400 mg).,"The abstract specifies that a single dose of D-cycloserine or valproic acid facilitated extinction and habituation effects after reinstatement, suggesting their utility in reducing relapse vulnerability during exposure-based therapy for anxiety disorders."
21418338,Sex differences in adolescent depression: do sex hormones determine vulnerability?,"Depression is one of the most common, costly and severe psychopathologies worldwide. Its incidence, however, differs significantly between the sexes, and depression rates in women are twice those of men. Interestingly, this sex difference emerges during adolescence. Although the adolescent period is characterised by major physical and behavioural transformations, it is unclear why the incidence of depression increases so dramatically in girls during this otherwise generally healthy developmental period. Although psychological and environmental factors are also involved, we discuss the neuroendocrinological factors determining adolescent vulnerability to depression.

Research suggests that major depressive disorder may affect terminally ill adults at a disproportionately high rate. Psychotherapy has not been shown to have consistent benefits among patients in the final months of life. Semi-psychotherapeutic (life review) techniques are likely most effective in patients in the final weeks of life. Non-psychotherapeutic techniques such as hypnotherapy have not been studied sufficiently to be recommended as first-line treatments.

A total of 1,128 individuals between 18 and 65 years old from a rural Brazilian population were included. Cronbach's alpha and factor analysis were performed for internal validation. Demographic variables means were compared, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, and sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values for different cutoff points were calculated for external validation and accuracy in detecting depression. Cronbach's alpha was 0.83, and only one factor was responsible for 59% of common variances, with an eigenvalue of 2.96. Higher WHO-Five scores were associated with being man, from oldest age category and retired. It was also related to better general health self-perception and negative screening in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on BDI, the area under the curve was 67.37.

22244032,Using algorithms and computerized decision support systems to treat major depression.,"The American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines for treating major depressive disorder advocate using measurement-based care and treatment algorithms, which have been shown to be effective strategies in improving patient outcomes. However, in practice, clinicians may avoid using algorithms and guidelines due to barriers such as lack of time, lack of staff support, and the perceived inflexibility of algorithms. Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) are one approach to increasing guideline adherence. A CDSS can make measurement-based care strategies accessible and user-friendly for physicians and staff, individualize treatment options according to each patient's circumstances, and provide guideline information at the point of care. In addition, a CDSS can be merged with electronic health record systems, which should simplify implementation and increase guideline adherence.",2011-Dec,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Interactive Tutorial; Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,What are two key advantages of using computerized decision support systems (CDSS) in the treatment of major depressive disorder?,CDSS individualizes treatment based on patient circumstances and increases guideline adherence by integrating with electronic health records.,"The abstract highlights that CDSS can tailor treatment to patient-specific needs and simplify implementation through electronic health record integration, improving adherence to guidelines."
21052750,The Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire: psychometric properties in Spanish postpartum women.,"The Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire (VPSQ) is a nine-item self-report scale developed to asses personality traits which increase the risk of postpartum depression. The aim of the present study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the VPSQ in a sample of postpartum women. A cohort of 309 postpartum women was followed up for 32 weeks after delivery. All women were assessed with the Spanish version of the VPSQ, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-R Short Scale, the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale and the harm avoidance dimension of the Temperament and Character Inventory at 2-3 days postpartum. Depressive symptoms were evaluated at 8 and 32 weeks after delivery by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and a diagnostic interview was used to confirm the presence of major depression disorder. Factor analysis results revealed the unidimensionality of the Spanish version of the VPSQ. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the VPSQ total score was 0.63. The test-retest reliability indicated a good temporal stability (ICC = 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-0.91). A moderate association between the VPSQ and other personality measures provided evidence for its construct validity. Logistic regression analyses showed that women with higher scores on the VPSQ had a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.11-1.29) and major depression (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.07-1.26) throughout the 32 weeks after delivery.

22020995,Emotional reactivity in infants with congenital heart defects and maternal symptoms of postnatal depression.,"The object of this study was to examine the role of emotional reactivity in infants with congenital heart defects (CHD) in relation to their mothers' symptoms of postnatal depression. The study population was drawn from the Norwegian country-wide CHD registry from the Department of Pediatric Cardiology at Oslo University Hospital and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Mother-infant dyads with mild/moderate or severe CHD (n=242) were assessed with a 6-item short version (EPDS-6) of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Infant Characteristic Questionnaire's fussy/difficult subscale (ICQ-D/F-7) at 6 months postpartum. When adjusting for infant emotional reactivity, mothers of infants with severe CHD showed significantly elevated symptoms of postnatal depression 6 months postpartum (odds ratio=2.22) compared to the mothers of infants with mild/moderate CHD. The results identify severe CHD in infants as a predictor of heightened symptoms of postnatal depression in mothers, independent of the infant's emotional reactivity.

21682949,Depressive symptom dimensions and cardiac prognosis following myocardial infarction: results from the ENRICHD clinical trial.,"Depression following myocardial infarction (MI) independently increases risk for early cardiac morbidity and mortality. Studies suggest that somatic, but not cognitive, depressive symptoms are responsible for the increased risk. However, the effects of somatic depressive symptoms at follow-up, after sufficient time has elapsed to allow for physical recovery from the initial infarction, are not known. Our aim was to examine the relationship between cognitive and somatic depressive symptom dimensions at baseline and 12 months post-MI and subsequent mortality and cardiovascular morbidity. Patients were 2442 depressed and/or socially isolated men and women with acute MI included in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) clinical trial. We used principal components analysis (PCA) of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) items to derive subscales measuring cognitive and somatic depressive symptom dimensions, and Cox regression with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to examine the contribution of these dimensions to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and first recurrent non-fatal MI. After adjusting for medical co-morbidity and Bonferroni correction, the somatic depressive symptom dimension assessed proximately following MI did not significantly predict any endpoints. At 12 months post-MI, however, this dimension independently predicted subsequent all-cause [hazard ratio (HR) 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.81] and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.17-2.18). No significant associations were found between the cognitive depressive symptom dimension and any endpoints after Bonferroni correction.

21241529,Heterogeneity in symptom profiles among older adults diagnosed with major depression.,"Late-life depression may be undiagnosed due to symptom expression. These analyses explore the structure of depressive symptoms in older patients diagnosed with major depression by identifying clusters of patients based on their symptom profiles. The sample comprised 366 patients enrolled in a naturalistic treatment study. Symptom profiles were defined using responses to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the depression section of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) administered at enrollment. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to place patients into homogeneous clusters. As a final step, we identified a risk profile from representative items across instruments selected through variable reduction techniques. A model with four discrete clusters provided the best fit to the data for the CES-D and the DIS depression module, while three clusters best fit the HAM-D. Using LCA to identify clusters of patients based on their endorsement of seventeen representative symptoms, we found three clusters of patients differing in ways other than severity. Age, sex, education, marital status, age of onset, functional limitations, level of perceived stress and subjective social support were differentially distributed across clusters. We found considerable heterogeneity in symptom profiles among older adults with an index episode of major depression. Clinical indicators such as depression history may play less of a role differentiating clusters of patients than variables such as stress, social support, and functional limitations.

However, very few studies have prospectively followed VLBW survivors into adulthood and none have examined adult psychiatric disorders in this population. This exploratory study sought to determine the rates and nature of psychiatric disorders in very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight < 1500 g) adults. 117 VLBW participants and 32 normal birth weight (NBW, birth weight > 2499 g) controls, born 1977-1982, were assessed in early adulthood (24-29 years). Participants were first screened for psychopathology using the Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90-R). Participants who were elevated on this measure were eligible for a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-I/NP) to determine a formal psychiatric diagnosis.

21683371,Quality of early mother-child interaction associated with depressive psychopathology in the offspring: a prospective study from infancy to adulthood.,"Evidence from animal research has revealed that less maternal care results in disturbed emotionality in the offspring. In the present study, the long-term impact of maternal responsiveness and stimulation during early mother-child interaction on depressive psychopathology was examined until adulthood. Data are from an epidemiological cohort study of the long-term outcome of early risk factors assessed at birth. At age 3 months, mothers and infants were videotaped during a nursing and playing situation. Maternal responsiveness and stimulation as well as infant responsiveness were evaluated by trained raters. At age 19 years, 314 participants (145 males, 169 females) were characterized on measures of depression through interview and questionnaire. In addition, measures of depression and anxiety were available from assessments in childhood. Results indicated that less maternal stimulation during early interaction was associated with a higher risk of depression in the offspring until the age of 19 years. In addition, children of less stimulating mothers showed more depressive symptoms at age 19 years and displayed more anxiety and depressive symptoms between the ages of 4.5 and 15 years. In contrast, maternal responsiveness was unrelated to children's outcome. In accordance with findings from animal research, the present study provides first longitudinal evidence in humans of a continuous and long-term influence of early maternal interaction behavior on the offspring's psychological adjustment until adulthood.

21967566,Do other people's plights matter? A genetically informed twin study of the role of social context in the link between peer victimization and children's aggression and depression symptoms.,"Using a genetically informed design, this study examined the additive and interactive effects of genetic risk, personal peer victimization experiences, and peer victimization experienced by others on children's aggression and depression symptoms. Of major interest was whether these effects varied depending on whether or not the victimized others were children's close friends. The sample comprised 197 monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs reared together (95 female pairs) assessed in Grade 4. Each twin's victimization experiences and victimization experienced by his or her friends and other classmates were measured using individuals' reports about their own levels of peer victimization. Aggression was assessed using peer nominations, and depression was measured using self-reports. Indicative of a possible social-learning mechanism or the emotional contagion of anger, multilevel regressions showed that personal victimization experiences were related to especially high levels of aggression when close friends where also highly victimized, albeit only in boys. Moreover, in line with social comparison theory, the effect of frequent personal victimization experiences on depressive feelings was much weaker when close friends were also highly victimized than when close friends were not or were only rarely victimized. Finally, a high level of peer victimization experienced by other classmates was related to a lower level of aggression in girls and boys, possibly because of a heightened sense of threat in classrooms where many suffer attacks from bullies. All of these results were independent of children's genetic risk for aggression or depression. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",2013-Feb,Developmental psychology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Twin Study",2011,YES,sa,How might the depressive symptoms of a child experiencing frequent peer victimization differ based on whether their close friends are also frequently victimized?,Depressive symptoms are weaker when close friends are also frequently victimized.,"The abstract suggests that social comparison theory explains this phenomenon: children compare their victimization to that of their close friends, and shared victimization may reduce the emotional burden, leading to weaker depressive symptoms."
21790673,Histone deacetylases (HDAC)-induced histone modifications in the amygdala: a role in rapid tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol.,"Rapid tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol appears to be an important factor in the development of alcoholism. Here, we investigated the involvement of amygdaloid histone deacetylases (HDAC)-induced epigenetic changes in rapid ethanol tolerance (RET). RET in rats was induced by 2 ethanol injections administered 24 hours apart. Both ethanol-tolerant and control rats were treated with the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), and anxiety-like behaviors were measured. HDAC activity, histone (H3 and H4) acetylation, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression in the amygdala of these rats were also measured. A single ethanol exposure was able to produce an anxiolytic response, inhibit amygdaloid HDAC activity, and increase both histone acetylation and NPY expression (mRNA and protein levels) in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) and medial nucleus of amygdala (MeA) of rats. In contrast, 2 exposures of the same dose of ethanol (24 hours apart) neither elicited a similar anxiolytic response nor modulated HDAC activity, histone acetylation, or NPY expression in the amygdala. However, exposure to a higher dose of ethanol on the second day was able to produce an anxiolytic response and also inhibit amygdaloid HDAC activity. TSA treatment caused the reversal of RET by inhibiting HDAC activity, thereby increasing histone acetylation and NPY expression in the CeA and MeA.

21030216,Shared changes in gene expression in frontal cortex of four genetically modified mouse models of depression.,"This study aimed to identify whether genetic manipulation of four systems implicated in the pathogenesis of depression converge on shared molecular processes underpinning depression-like behaviour in mice. Altered 5HT function was modelled using the 5-HT transporter knock out mouse, impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function using an antisense-induced knock down mouse, disrupted glutamate function using a heterozygous KO of the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 gene, and impaired cannabinoid signalling using the cannabinoid 1 receptor KO mouse. All 4 four genetically modified mice were previously shown to show exaggerated helpless behaviour compared to wild-type controls and variable degrees of anxiety and anhedonic behaviour. mRNA was extracted from frontal cortex and hybridised to Illumina microarrays. Combined contrast analysis was used to identify genes showing different patterns of up- and down-regulation across the 4 models. 1823 genes were differentially regulated. They were over-represented in gene ontology categories of metabolism, protein handling and synapse. In each model compared to wild-type mice of the same genetic background, a number of genes showed increased expression changes of >10%, other genes showed decreases in each model. Most of the genes showed mixed effects. Several previous array findings were replicated.

Evaluations were conducted using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Profile of Mood States (POMS). The results showed that changes in the flashback, hyper-arousal, avoidance behavior, and total scores on the IES-R and anxiety and depression scores on the POMS differed significantly between the two groups. These results suggest that a group intervention approach can lessen the psychological burden of nurses exposed to violence and reduce their mental stress.",2011,ISRN nursing,Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,What psychological symptoms related to trauma and mood disorders are most likely to improve with a group intervention for nurses exposed to workplace violence?,"Flashbacks, hyper-arousal, avoidance behavior, anxiety, and depression.","The abstract specifies that a group intervention significantly reduced flashbacks, hyper-arousal, avoidance behavior (IES-R measures) and anxiety and depression (POMS measures) in nurses exposed to violent speech/violence."
21168918,Chronic conditions and major depression in community-dwelling older adults.,"To estimate (1) the prevalence of long-term medical conditions and of comorbid major depression, and (2) the associations between major depression and various chronic medical conditions in a general population of older adults (over 50 years of age) and in persons who are traditionally classified as seniors (65 years and older). Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey- Mental Health and Wellbeing (CCHS-1.2) were analyzed. Non-institutionalized individuals over 15 years of age in the 10 Canadian provinces were sampled in the CCHS-1.2. The entire sample of the CCHS-1.2 consisted of 36,894 individuals, for the main analyses in this study the dataset was restricted to those aged 50 and over (n=15,591). Chronic health conditions were assessed using a self-report method of doctor diagnosis. The World Mental Health-Composite Diagnostic Interview was used to asses major depressive episodes based on DSM-IV criteria. The overall prevalence of having at least one chronic condition in those over 50 years of age was 82.4%, compared to 62.0% in those under 50. The prevalence of a major depressive episode in those over 50 with one chronic condition was 3.7%, compared with 1.0% in those without a long-term medical condition. The top 3 chronic health conditions in seniors aged 65 or older were arthritis/rheumatism, high blood pressure and back problems. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, fibromyalgia and migraine headache had the highest comorbidity with major depression in the senior population. The use of self-report data on chronic health conditions, potential diagnostic overlap between conditions, and the inability to make causal inferences due to the cross-sectional nature of the data are all limitations of the current study. Differences were found between rates of chronic conditions and major depression between the general population, older adults and seniors in this study. Further research is needed to delineate the direction of these relationships in seniors. Primary and secondary prevention efforts should target seniors who exhibit symptoms of depression or highly prevalent chronic health conditions.",2011-Jun,Journal of affective disorders,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,What chronic medical conditions in seniors are most strongly associated with comorbid major depression?,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, fibromyalgia, and migraine headache.","The abstract identifies Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, fibromyalgia, and migraine headache as the chronic conditions with the highest comorbidity with major depression in the senior population."
22737444,"Depression and anxiety in patients with epilepsy, with or without other chronic disorders.","Most people with epilepsy lead a normal emotional and cognitive life, however neurobehavioral problems can be found in a large number of patients. This study evaluates the prevalence of depression and anxiety among patients with epilepsy and determines whether having other chronic somatic illnesses increases the prevalence. Adults with epilepsy were recruited in either the inpatient epilepsy monitoring unit or the Outpatient Epilepsy Clinic at Thomas Jefferson University in 2006. Patients anonymously filled out a questionnaire, included data about age, sex, education, having other chronic illnesses, and degree of seizure control. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale was used to define the presence or absence of anxiety and depression.  Two hundreds patients participated, with a mean age of 40.3±16 years. Nineteen (9.5%) patients had depression and 49 (24.5%) had anxiety. Age, seizure control, and having other chronic illnesses did not have a significant relationship with either depression or anxiety. Gender was significantly related to anxiety, with females displaying greater frequency of anxiety than males. Depression was inversely related to education. It is probable that people with higher education use more effective ways to psychologically and physically adapt to their illness.",2011-Feb,Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,What demographic and psychosocial factors are associated with higher prevalence rates of anxiety and depression in adults with epilepsy?,Females are more likely to experience anxiety; lower education levels are associated with higher depression prevalence.,"The abstract states that gender is significantly related to anxiety, with females at greater risk, and depression is inversely related to education, suggesting higher education promotes better psychological adaptation."
22738250,Criteria of validity for animal models of psychiatric disorders: focus on anxiety disorders and depression.,"Animal models of psychiatric disorders are usually discussed with regard to three criteria first elaborated by Willner; face, predictive and construct validity. Here, we draw the history of these concepts and then try to redraw and refine these criteria, using the framework of the diathesis model of depression that has been proposed by several authors. We thus propose a set of five major criteria (with sub-categories for some of them); homological validity (including species validity and strain validity), pathogenic validity (including ontopathogenic validity and triggering validity), mechanistic validity, face validity (including ethological and biomarker validity) and predictive validity (including induction and remission validity). Homological validity requires that an adequate species and strain be chosen: considering species validity, primates will be considered to have a higher score than drosophila, and considering strains, a high stress reactivity in a strain scores higher than a low stress reactivity in another strain. Pathological validity corresponds to the fact that, in order to shape pathological characteristics, the organism has been manipulated both during the developmental period (for example, maternal separation: ontopathogenic validity) and during adulthood (for example, stress: triggering validity). Mechanistic validity corresponds to the fact that the cognitive (for example, cognitive bias) or biological mechanisms (such as dysfunction of the hormonal stress axis regulation) underlying the disorder are identical in both humans and animals. Face validity corresponds to the observable behavioral (ethological validity) or biological (biomarker validity) outcomes: for example anhedonic behavior (ethological validity) or elevated corticosterone (biomarker validity). Finally, predictive validity corresponds to the identity of the relationship between the triggering factor and the outcome (induction validity) and between the effects of the treatments on the two organisms (remission validity). The relevance of this framework is then discussed regarding various animal models of depression.",2011-Nov-07,Biology of mood & anxiety disorders,Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,What criterion would best assess whether the biological mechanism underlying stress regulation dysfunction in an animal model mirrors that of humans in depression?,Mechanistic validity,"Mechanistic validity evaluates whether cognitive or biological mechanisms, such as hormonal stress axis dysfunction, are identical in humans and the animal model, as described in the abstract."
22937403,Severe neuropsychiatric reaction in a deployed military member after prophylactic mefloquine.,"Recent studies of military personnel who have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan have reported a number of combat-related psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and traumatic brain injury. This case report involves a 27-year-old male active-duty US military service member who developed severe depression, psychotic hallucinations, and neuropsychological sequelae following the prophylactic use of the antimalarial medication mefloquine hydrochloride. The patient had a recent history of depression and was taking antidepressant medications at the time of his deployment to the Middle East. Psychiatrists and other health care providers should be aware of the possible neuropsychiatric side effects of mefloquine in deployed military personnel and should consider the use of other medications for malaria prophylaxis in those individuals who may be at increased risk for side effects.",2011,Case reports in psychiatry,Case Reports; Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,What factors should be considered before prescribing mefloquine hydrochloride for malaria prophylaxis in a military service member with a history of depression?,"History of depression and current antidepressant use increase risk of severe neuropsychiatric side effects, including depression and psychotic hallucinations.","The abstract highlights that mefloquine can cause severe neuropsychiatric side effects, particularly in individuals with a history of depression or those on antidepressants, necessitating alternative prophylactic options."
21258946,A mono-institutional prospective study on the effectiveness of a specialist psychotherapeutic intervention (POI) started at the diagnosis of cancer.,"We evaluated the effectiveness of an early POI in newly diagnosed cancer patients in reducing the occurrence of psychiatric disturbances. We designed a mono-institutional prospective study involving all new patients admitted to the Oncology Department of Fatebenefratelli and Ophtalmic Hospital in Milan from January 2005 until September 2008. During the first visit, the oncologist could offer support with a psycho-oncologist. The patients who accepted had a first interview (T0), during which they took a self-evaluation test (HADS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). On the basis of the score, the psycho-oncologist could offer psychotherapy and/or pharmacological intervention, if necessary. At the end of the eight sessions (T1), the patient repeated the self-evaluation test with the HADS, and we analysed both the difference in the HADS score between T0 and T1 and the clinical evaluation of the psycho-oncologist. Three hundred eighteen patients were evaluated with a psychoanalytical psychotherapy approach by two psycho-oncologists through a first interview and 90 of them were eligible for the present study also for the evaluation of HADS. The average HADS score in T0 was 15.26 for depression (sd=3.21) and 13.86 for anxiety (sd = 2.05). The reassessment at the end of the psychotherapy (T1) showed an average HADS score of 5.94 for depression (sd = 3.11) and 6.58 for anxiety (sd = 2.88). Only five patients were treated with a pharmacological approach alone. Considering all the limits of our study, we may conclude that an early POI significantly reduces patients' psychiatric symptoms and the risk of a negative evolution of pathological situations in those patients who are motivated and express a need for psychological help.",2012-Mar,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,"What intervention strategy significantly reduced both anxiety and depression scores in newly diagnosed cancer patients, and what criteria determined patient eligibility for this intervention?",Early psycho-oncological intervention (POI) with psychotherapy significantly reduced scores.

21263011,State-dependent alteration in face emotion recognition in depression.,"Negative biases in emotional processing are well recognised in people who are currently depressed but are less well described in those with a history of depression, where such biases may contribute to vulnerability to relapse. To compare accuracy, discrimination and bias in face emotion recognition in those with current and remitted depression. The sample comprised a control group (n = 101), a currently depressed group (n = 30) and a remitted depression group (n = 99). Participants provided valid data after receiving a computerised face emotion recognition task following standardised assessment of diagnosis and mood symptoms. In the control group women were more accurate in recognising emotions than men owing to greater discrimination. Among participants with depression, those in remission correctly identified more emotions than controls owing to increased response bias, whereas those currently depressed recognised fewer emotions owing to decreased discrimination. These effects were most marked for anger, fear and sadness but there was no significant emotion × group interaction, and a similar pattern tended to be seen for happiness although not for surprise or disgust. These differences were confined to participants who were antidepressant-free, with those taking antidepressants having similar results to the control group. Abnormalities in face emotion recognition differ between people with current depression and those in remission. Reduced discrimination in depressed participants may reflect withdrawal from the emotions of others, whereas the increased bias in those with a history of depression could contribute to vulnerability to relapse. The normal face emotion recognition seen in those taking medication may relate to the known effects of antidepressants on emotional processing and could contribute to their ability to protect against depressive relapse.",2011-Apr,The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,How does antidepressant use influence face emotion recognition in individuals with remitted depression?,"Antidepressant use normalizes face emotion recognition, making it similar to controls.","The abstract states that individuals with remitted depression who are antidepressant-free show increased response bias, while those on antidepressants exhibit normal face emotion recognition, suggesting antidepressants mitigate biases and protect against relapse by influencing emotional processing."
21871069,"PTSD, depression and anxiety among former abductees in Northern Uganda.","The population in Northern Uganda has been exposed to extreme levels of traumatic stress and thousands abducted forcibly became rebel combatants. Using structured interviews, the prevalence and severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety was assessed in 72 former abducted adults, 62 of them being former child soldiers. As retrospective reports of exposure to traumatic stress increased, anxiety and PTSD occurrence increased (r = .45). 49% of respondents were diagnosed with PTSD, 70% presented with symptoms of depression, and 59% with those of anxiety. In a multiple linear regression analysis four factors could best explain the development of PTSD symptoms: male respondents (sex) living in an IDP-Camp (location) with a kinship murdered in the war (family members killed in the war) and having experienced a high number of traumatic events (number of traumatic events) were more likely to develop symptoms of PTSD than others. In disagreement to a simple dose-response-effect though, we also observed a negative correlation between the time spent with the rebels and the PTSD symptom level. Former abductees continue to suffer from severe mental ill-health. Adaptation to the living condition of rebels, however, may lower trauma-related mental suffering.",2011-Aug-26,Conflict and health,Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,What factors are associated with an increased likelihood of developing PTSD symptoms in former abductees living in Northern Uganda?,"Male sex, living in an IDP camp, having a family member murdered in the war, and experiencing a high number of traumatic events.",The abstract identifies these four factors as significant predictors of PTSD symptoms based on multiple linear regression analysis of former abductees in Northern Uganda.
21890582,Modulation of anxiety behavior in the elevated plus maze using peptidic oxytocin and vasopressin receptor ligands in the rat.,"Oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), in their capacities as neuromodulators, are believed to play an important role in mood control, including regulation of the anxiety response. In the present study, the contributions of oxytocin and vasopressin receptor modulation to anxiety-like behaviors were examined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The behavioral effects of the OT receptor agonist, carbetocin (intracerebroventricular, intravenous and intraperitoneal routes), the AVP receptor agonist desmopressin (intravenous route), and the OT/AVP(1A) receptor antagonist atosiban (intravenous route) were evaluated in the elevated plus maze. The benzodiazepine diazepam was included as a positive control. Central but not systemic administration of carbetocin produced pronounced anxiolytic-like behavioral changes comparable to those measured following systemic diazepam treatment. The anxiolytic efficacy of carbetocin was maintained following 10 days of once-daily treatment, contrasting with the effects of diazepam which were no longer distinguishable from saline treatment. Systemic administration of desmopressin produced anxiogenic-like effects whereas systemic atosiban produced anxiolytic-like effects. Co-administration of desmopressin with atosiban resulted in saline-like behavioral responses, implicating an AVP(1A) receptor mechanism in the anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects of these neuropeptides following systemic administration. A peripherally-mediated antidiuretic effect of desmopressin on water consumption was also demonstrated. These results highlight the potential therapeutic utility of AVP(1A) receptor blockade in the modulation of anxiety-related behaviors; AVP(1A) receptor blockade appears to be a more promising pharmacological target than does OT receptor activation following systemic drug administration.",2012-Apr,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,What pharmacological mechanism might explain the sustained anxiolytic effects of carbetocin compared to diazepam after 10 days of treatment?,Central oxytocin receptor activation.,"The abstract notes that central administration of carbetocin produced sustained anxiolytic effects over 10 days, unlike diazepam.

Empirical researches concerning its diagnosis and treatment have not yet explored the potential implications of deficits in emotional intelligence (EI) as a vulnerability factor in its development. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between EI and clinical symptoms in a group of psychiatric patients with GAD compared to the control group. Seventy outpatients (82.9% female) with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of GAD and 70 control individuals (72.9% female) completed self-report instruments assessing EI and clinical symptoms in a cross-sectional study. Significant correlations were observed between EI dimensions such as clarity (r = .327) and repair (r = .405) and symptoms of anxiety.

21871935,Intracerebroventricular administration of neuronostatin induces depression-like effect in forced swim test of mice.,"Neuronostatin is a recently discovered endogenous bioactive peptide that is encoded by pro-mRNA of somatostatin. In the present study, we investigated the effect of neuronostatin on mood regulation in the forced swim test of mice. Our results showed intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of neuronostatin produced an increase in the immobility time, suggesting that neuronostatin induced depression-like effect. In order to rule out the possibility that neuronostatin had increased immobility time by a non-specific reduction in general activity, the effect of neuronostatin on locomotor activity was examined. Neuronostatin had no influence on locomotor activity in mice. In addition, the depression-like effect of neuronostatin was completely reversed by melanocortin 3/4 receptor antagonist SHU9119 or GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, but not by opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. These data suggested that the depression-like effect induced by i.c.v. administered neuronostatin was dependent upon the central melanocortin system and GABAA receptor. In conclusion, the results of this study report that neuronostatin induces depression-like effect.

21824753,Default-mode network connectivity and white matter burden in late-life depression.,"The brain's default-mode network has been the focus of intense research. This study characterizes the default-mode network activity in late-life depression and the correlation of the default-mode network activity changes with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. We hypothesized that elderly depressed subjects would have altered default-mode network activity, which would correlate with the increased white-matter hyperintensities burden. Twelve depressed subjects (mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 19.8±4.1, mean age 70.5±4.9) and 12 non-depressed, comparison subjects (mean age 69±6.5) were included. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected while subjects performed a low cognitive load, event-related task. We compared the default-mode network activity in these groups (including depressed subjects pre- and post-antidepressant treatment). We analyzed the resting connectivity patterns of the posterior cingulate cortex. Deconvolution was used to evaluate the correlation of resting-state connectivity scores with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. Compared with non-depressed elderly, depressed subjects pretreatment had decreased connectivity in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and increased connectivity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the orbito-frontal cortex. The abnormal connectivity was significantly correlated with the white-matter hyperintensities burden. Remitted elderly depressed subjects had improved functional connectivity compared to pretreatment, although alterations persisted in the anterior cingulate and the prefrontal cortex when remitted elderly depressed subjects were compared with non-depressed elderly.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome and depressive symptoms in a Japanese working population. The study subjects comprised 458 municipal employees (age range 21-67 years) from two municipal offices in Japan. A modified version of the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III was used to define metabolic syndrome. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES_D) scale.

21723926,Increased interactions between PKA and NF-κB signaling in the hippocampus following loss of cholinergic input.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression are frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the degeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons and reductions in acetylcholine that occur in AD have been identified as potential mediators of these secondary neuropsychiatric symptomologies. Indeed, removal of cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus via selective immunolesions of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons induces dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and decreases glucocorticoid receptor expression (GR). A subsequent study showed that loss of cholinergic input decreases the activity of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKAc) and lessens the interaction of protein kinase A (PKA) with GR. Because cross-coupling between nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and GR depends on PKA signaling, the present study was conducted to evaluate the status of NF-κB as well as interactions of PKA with NF-κB in the hippocampus following cholinergic denervation. Expression of cytosolic NF-κB p65 was diminished and IκB was degraded in the hippocampus of cholinergic immunolesioned rats compared to the controls. Immunolesions also increased NF-κB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, as well as interactions between PKAc and NF-κB p65. These results indicate that loss of cholinergic input to the hippocampus results in decreased PKA activity and increased NF-κB activity. Such altered signaling may contribute to psychiatric symptoms, including depression, in patients with AD.",2011-Sep-29,Neuroscience,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,How might the loss of cholinergic input to the hippocampus contribute to the development of depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease?,"It decreases PKA activity, reduces GR expression, and activates NF-κB signaling, which may disrupt stress-response regulation.","The abstract links cholinergic denervation to reduced PKA activity, diminished GR expression, and increased NF-κB activity, all of which can dysregulate HPA axis function and stress-response mechanisms, contributing to depression in Alzheimer's disease."
20925656,Annual Research Review: All mothers are not created equal: neural and psychobiological perspectives on mothering and the importance of individual differences.,"Quality of mothering relies on the integrity of multiple physiological and behavioral systems and on two maternal factors, one proximal and one distal, that have a great impact on how a mother mothers: postpartum depression and early experiences. To mother appropriately requires the action of systems that regulate sensation, perception, affect, reward, executive function, motor output and learning. When a mother is at risk to engage in less than optimal mothering, such as when she is depressed or has experienced adversity in childhood, the function of many or all of maternal and related systems may be affected. In this paper, we will review what is currently known about the biological basis of mothering, with attention to literature on hormones but with a particular focus on recent advances in the fields of functional neuroimaging. Instead of discussing strictly 'maternal' brain imaging studies, we instead use a systems approach to survey important findings relevant to brain systems integral to and/or strongly related to the mothering experience: (a) social behavior; (b) reward and affect; (c) executive function; and (d) maternal behavior. We find that there are many commonalities in terms of the brain regions identified across these systems and, as we would expect, all are sensitive to the influence of, or function differently in the context of, depression and adverse early experience. It is likely that the similarity and cross-talk between maternal, affect and stress systems, observed behaviorally, hormonally and in the context of brain function, allows for mood disturbance and early adverse experiences to have a significant impact on the quality of mothering and the motivation to mother.",2011-Apr,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",Journal Article; Review,2011,YES,sa,How might postpartum depression and adverse childhood experiences impact brain systems involved in maternal behavior?,"They can disrupt systems regulating affect, reward, executive function, learning, and social behavior, impairing maternal motivation and quality of mothering.","The abstract states these factors affect brain systems integral to mothering, including reward, affect, executive function, and social behavior, leading to impaired maternal functioning."
21615702,Six month outcomes of an innovative weekly intergenerational day program with older adults and school-aged children in a Japanese urban community.,"To describe the nature of the progression of intergenerational interactions among and between older people and children in a weekly intergenerational day program (IDP) in an urban community and to evaluate the older people's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and depressive symptoms, compared to the program volunteers, as well as the children's perspectives of older people, during the first 6 months of the program's implementation. This longitudinal study, with a convenience sample of older people (n = 14), program volunteers (n = 8), and school-aged children (n = 7), used mixed methods to analyze the results. Participant observations and interviews were used to describe the interactions between the generations over the 6 months. An ANOVA with repeated measures was used to determine the statistical effects over time (initially and at 3 months and 6 months) for HRQOL (Medical Outcomes Study 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey) and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS-15). Semantic differential scales identified the children's perspectives of older people. The intergenerational interactions were grouped into thirteen categories; for example, ""The IDP provided a meaningful sense of place."" The quality of life in relation to the mental health of the older people's group improved significantly between the first involvement and after 6 months, while the GDS-15 scores significantly decreased at the three time points in the more depressed older people's subgroup. The children's initial generally positive perspectives of older people showed no statistically significant change over time. The intergenerational interactions in the IDP yielded a meaningful place for both generations, improved the HRQOL of the older people's group, and decreased the depressive symptoms in the more depressed older people's subgroup.",2011-Jun,Japan journal of nursing science : JJNS,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,"What statistical method can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an interventional program on depressive symptoms over time in a subgroup of older adults, and what specific tool is appropriate for measuring these symptoms?",ANOVA with repeated measures; Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15).,"The abstract specifies that ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze depressive symptoms over time, with the GDS-15 as the tool for measuring depression in older adults participating in the program."
20888355,Anxiety-like behavior in weanling and young adult male and female malnourished rats.,"The present study determined whether protein-calorie malnutrition alters anxiety-like behavior in weanling and young adult, male and female malnourished rats. On the day of birth, litters of Wistar rats were divided into Control (C) and Malnutrition (M) groups. In the C group, litters were fed by dams receiving ad libitum lab chow, whereas in the M group, litters were fed by dams receiving 40% of the total amount of the diet offered to dams in the C group. After weaning (PND21) until PND50, animals received the same food as theirs mothers (i.e., ad libitum access in the C group and 40% of the C group food in the M group). On PND21 and PND50, independent C (male [CM] and female [CF]) and M (male [MM] and female [MF]) groups were exposed to the elevated T-maze. The time taken to withdraw four paws from this arm was recorded (baseline latency [BL]). The same measurement was repeated twice at 30s intervals (avoidance trial 1 [AT1] and avoidance 2 [AT2]). The cutoff time in each trial was 300s. ANOVA indicated a four-way age×diet×sex×trials interaction. Post hoc comparisons revealed that PND50 rats had a lower BL and AT1 latency compared with PND21 rats. Training increased both AT1 and AT2 latencies compared with BL in both the CM and CF groups. Weanling malnourished rats exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior and young adult male rats presented less anxiety-like behavior than young adult female rats in this experimental model.",2011-Jan-10,Physiology & behavior,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2011,YES,sa,How might early-life protein-calorie malnutrition influence the expression of anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats at different developmental stages?,Malnourished weanlings show reduced anxiety-like behavior; young adult malnourished males exhibit less anxiety-like behavior than females.,"The abstract shows that protein-calorie malnutrition reduces anxiety-like behavior in weanlings, while in young adults, males display less anxiety-like behavior than females, suggesting sex- and age-dependent effects."
22001975,"Anxiolytic-like activity of MGS0039, a selective group II mGlu receptor antagonist, is serotonin- and GABA-dependent.","In the present study, we examined the anxiolytic-like effects of (1R,2R,3R,5R,6R)-2-amino-3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-6fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (MGS0039), a mGluR2/3 antagonist, in the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats. MGS0039 administered at the doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg ip (yet not at 3 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects in this test. Diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg) was used as a reference drug. In the second part of our experiment, MGS0039 was tested at an effective dose of 2 mg/kg after a mixed injection with ritanserin (5-HT(2A/C) receptor antagonist) and WAY100635 (5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) or flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), and all of the compounds were found to attenuate the effect of MGS0039. The above results indicate that the mGluR2/3 antagonist MGS0039 may play a role in the therapy of anxiety and that its action may be mediated by serotonin and the GABAergic systems.",2011,Pharmacological reports : PR,Comparative Study; Journal Article,2011,YES,sa,Which receptor systems are implicated in the attenuation of anxiolytic-like effects of an mGluR2/3 antagonist in preclinical models of anxiety disorders?,Serotonin (5-HT) and GABAergic systems.,"The abstract states that the anxiolytic-like effects of the mGluR2/3 antagonist MGS0039 were attenuated by ritanserin (5-HT2A/C antagonist), WAY100635 (5-HT1A antagonist), and flumazenil (GABA receptor antagonist), implicating serotonin and GABAergic systems in its mechanism of action."
