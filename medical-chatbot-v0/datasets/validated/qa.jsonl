The purpose of the current study was to examine differences in suicidal ideation, clinician-rated suicide risk, suicide attempts, and family history of suicide in a sample of outpatients diagnosed with various forms of depressive illness. To accomplish this aim, we conducted a cluster analysis using the aforementioned suicide-related variables in a sample of 494 outpatients seen between January 2001 and July 2007 at the Florida State University Psychology Clinic. Patients were diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria. Two distinct clusters emerged that were indicative of lower and higher risk for suicide. After controlling for the number of comorbid Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, the only depressive illness that significantly predicted cluster membership was recurrent MDD, which tripled an individual's likelihood of being assigned to the higher risk cluster. The use of a cross-sectional design; the relatively low suicide risk in our sample; the relatively small number of individuals with double depression.

Additionally, in the same field, rating scales are frequently used to evaluate the status of the patients and the efficacy of new therapeutic procedures. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study the psychometric properties of these instruments within a longitudinal framework. In the area of depression, the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) is regularly used for antidepressant treatment evaluation. However, the use of HAMD has not been exempted from criticism what has lead to the development of new scales that are expected to be more sensitive for change, such as the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS). In general, the reliability of these scales has been extensively studied by using classical methods for reliability estimation, developed for specifically designed reliability studies. Unfortunately, the settings customarily considered in these reliability studies are usually far from the practical conditions in which these scales are applied in clinical trials and practice. In the present paper, we assess the reliability of these instruments in a more realistic scenario thereby using longitudinal data coming from clinical studies. Nowadays, newly developed methodology based on an extended concept of reliability, allows us to use longitudinal data for reliability estimation. This new approach not only enables to avoid bias by offering a better control of disturbing factors but it also produces more precise estimates by taking advantage of the large sample taking sizes available in clinical trials. Further, it offers practical guidelines for an optimal use of a rating scale in order to achieve a particular level of reliability. The merits of this new approach are illustrated by applying it on two clinical trials in depression to assess the reliability of the three outcome scales, HAMD, MADRS, and the Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HAMA).", "journal": "Journal of psychiatric research", "year": "2008", "classification": "YES", "confidence": {"reflects_sure": true, "quality_sure": true}}

Administration of CART (54-102) into the lateral ventricle (50 and 100 ng) and bilaterally in the CeA (10 and 20 ng) caused a significant reduction in social interaction, suggesting an anxiogenic action of the peptide. Chronic ethanol treatment for 15 days followed by withdrawal precipitated an anxiogenic response at 24 h that was attenuated by intracerebroventricular (5 mul) and intra-CeA (1 mul) administration of antibodies against CART (1 : 500 dilution). An immunocytochemistry protocol was employed to study the response of the endogenous CART system in the CeA following chronic ethanol withdrawal. At 0 h ethanol withdrawal, CART immunoreactivity was apparent in few fibers and the profile was similar to that in the pair-fed control rats. Twenty-four hours following ethanol withdrawal, a highly significant increase (P<0.001) in CART immunoreactivity was noticed in the CeA, which returned to normal 48 and 72 h post-withdrawal. Similar doses of CART or CART antibody injected bilaterally into the BNSTl or AcbSh produced no response in the social interaction test. Furthermore, the CART immunoreactivity profile did not change at the post-withdrawal time points in each of these brain sites.

Comparisons between 73 hearing-impaired subjects and 96 controls, well-matched for socio-demographic variables, were performed using the HHIA, MOS 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and SFQ questionnaires scores and revealed that the former experience a higher level of perceived hearing handicap and a deterioration of health-related quality of life while investigating emotional and socio-situational domains than the latter (p < 0.005).

Initial trials suggest that it may be an effective treatment, with few side-effects, for intractable depression. An open, uncontrolled European multi-centre study (D03) of VNS therapy was conducted, in addition to stable pharmacotherapy, in 74 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Treatment remained unchanged for the first 3 months; in the subsequent 9 months, medications and VNS dosing parameters were altered as indicated clinically. The baseline 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-28) score averaged 34. After 3 months of VNS, response rates (> or = 50% reduction in baseline scores) reached 37% and remission rates (HAMD-28 score <10) 17%. Response rates increased to 53% after 1 year of VNS, and remission rates reached 33%. Response was defined as sustained if no relapse occurred during the first year of VNS after response onset; 44% of patients met these criteria. Median time to response was 9 months. Most frequent side-effects were voice alteration (63% at 3 months of stimulation) and coughing (23%). VNS therapy was effective in reducing severity of depression; efficacy increased over time. Efficacy ratings were in the same range as those previously reported from a USA study using a similar protocol; at 12 months, reduction of symptom severity was significantly higher in the European sample. This might be explained by a small but significant difference in the baseline HAMD-28 score and the lower number of treatments in the current episode in the European study.", "journal": "Psychological medicine", "year": "2008", "classification": "YES", "confidence": {"reflects_sure": true, "quality_sure": true}}

Since opiate withdrawal is associated with increased anxiety in both humans and animals, this study aimed to investigate the possible sensitization of the neural substrates of fear in the midbrain tectum and its influence on the morphine withdrawal-induced anxiety. For the production of drug withdrawal, rats received morphine injections (10 mg/kg; s.c.) twice daily during 10 days. Forty-eight hours after the interruption of the chronic treatment, independent groups were probed in the elevated plus-maze and open-field tests. Additional groups of animals were implanted with a bipolar electrode into the dPAG or the IC and submitted to the electrical stimulation of these structures for the determination of the freezing and escape thresholds after 48 h of withdrawal. Our results showed that the morphine withdrawal promoted clear-cut levels of anxiety without the somatic signs of opiate withdrawal. Moreover, morphine-withdrawn rats had an increase in the reactivity to the electrical stimulation of the dPAG and the IC. These findings suggest that the increased anxiety induced by morphine withdrawal is associated with the sensitization of the neural substrates of fear in the dPAG and the IC.

There are numerous suicide-related findings pertaining to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate nucleus and thalamus, which form a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit responsible for executive function and working memory. An aberrant CSTC circuitry is hypothesized to be implicated in depressed patients with a high suicidal risk. 27 MDD patients were assessed with the Nurses Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR), following which 14 patients were classified into a high suicide risk group (NGASR ≥ 12) and 13 patients were assigned to a low suicide risk group (NGASR < 6).

There was a significantly lower alpha-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the right caudate and left thalamus in high-risk suicide group compared to both the low-risk suicide group and healthy controls. The presence of a weaker coupling between the right caudate and left thalamus is indicative of a caudothalamic abnormality in suicidally depressed patients.

Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is an intravenous anesthetic agent used in outpatient settings. It is a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A agonist and has affinity at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Elevation in mood and sociality in humans has been observed following propofol-induced anesthesia. Other authors reported an open-label study of repeated dosing of propofol in treatment-resistant depression in which several patients experienced sustained improvement. Recently, we reported that in a rodent model of despair, a forced swim test, 45 minutes after administration of 50 mg/kg propofol, immobility time was significantly reduced. The objective of the experiment was to determine whether the antidepressant-like effects of a single dose of propofol in mice are sustained for 24 hours. The time spent immobile during a forced swim test 24 hours after intraperitoneal administration of a single dose of propofol 50 mg/kg or 0.9% saline was evaluated in 24 adult male mice (C57/BL6). Immobility time was quantified and evaluated with a custom video analysis software program.

However, the information related to the capability of melatonin to modulate dendrite maturation and complexity in the dorsal and ventral regions of the DG and their correlation with its antidepressant-like effect is absent. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the impact of melatonin (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) administered daily for fourteen days on the number, dendrite complexity and distribution of doublecortin (DCX)-cells in the dorsal-ventral regions of the DG in male Balb/C mice. Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein that is expressed during the course of dendritic maturation of newborn neurons. Also, we analyzed the impact of melatonin on despair-like behavior in the forced swim test. We first found a significant increase in the number and higher dendrite complexity, mainly with the doses of 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg of melatonin (81%, 122%, 78%). These cells showed more complex dendritic trees in the ventral- and the dorsal- DG. Concomitantly, the doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg of melatonin decreased depressant-like behavior (76%, 82%). Finally, the data corroborate the antidepressant-like effect of melatonin and the increasing number of doublecortin-associated cells. Besides, the data indicate that melatonin favors the number and dendrite complexity of DCX-cells in the dorsal- and ventral- region of the DG, which may explain part of the antidepressant-like effect of melatonin.", "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences", "year": "2020", "classification": "YES", "confidence": {"reflects_sure": true, "quality_sure": true}}

Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited. During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score ≥10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score≥10 vs GAD-7 score<10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis. Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income <200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38% and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n=41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score ≥10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p=0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist.

ABSTRACT: A significant proportion of the UK population are taking antidepressants, and have been taking them for at least a year. Clinical guidelines have controversially stated that withdrawal symptoms when weaning off antidepressants are mild and resolve after one week, with the proviso that they can be severe only if the drug is stopped abruptly. However, recent evidence suggests this is not the case. I describe my own experiences of tapering the dose of my antidepressants after several years of taking them. I describe my encounters with healthcare professionals throughout this period, detailing conflicting advice I have received, along with describing the mental and physical withdrawal symptoms I have experienced. My experiences relate to a growing body of research, which have important implications for improving care. Potential learning outcomes are that healthcare professionals should make patients aware of potential withdrawal symptoms they may experience before they wean off antidepressants; regularly review their progress; consider helping them access psychological support whilst weaning off; and engage in open and collaborative conversations with patients throughout the process.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of an alternative person-centered approach, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), to model change over time that focuses on the interdependence of daily student motivation levels and teacher feedback and their relations to student outcomes over time. Specifically, we used GIMME to model person level responses to negative teacher feedback regarding students' next day motivational ratings using data from 58 5th grade students participating in a study of the impact of the self-monitoring and regulation training strategy (SMARTS). Results identified a set of SMARTS students whose daily readiness aligned with high rates of self and teacher agreement regarding ongoing performance ratings. However, results identified a group of students whose daily motivation and readiness for change was adversely impacted by negative teacher feedback the day before. For these students, they were more likely than their peers to experience high levels of depression and internalization scores.

We performed a systematic review (PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov until the 1st September 2020) and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using any statin against placebo or any other statin in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Our primary efficacy outcome measure was the mean value on any standardized scale for depressive symptoms at 8 weeks of treatment. We also calculated outcomes for efficacy, response, and remission at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, as well as acceptability (dropouts for any cause), tolerability (dropouts due to any adverse event), and safety (any adverse event) outcomes at the studies' endpoints. Furthermore, we conducted an exploratory network meta-analysis for the primary efficacy outcome to identify potential differences between statins. We retrieved five randomized controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria: four used a statin in addition to an antidepressant and compared it to placebo plus antidepressant, and one compared two statins alone. and one comparing one statin with another. Statins compared to placebo in addition to antidepressants were efficacious at 8 weeks (N = 255, SMD = -0.48, 95% CI = -0.74 to -0. 22) and 12 weeks (N = 134, SMD = -0.47, 95% CI = -0.89 to -0.05, moderate certainty) with no difference for acceptability, tolerability, and safety (low certainty).

This study aimed to examine the effects of using virtual reality (VR) intervention before circumcision on the pre-and postoperative anxiety and fear levels and postoperative pain symptoms in children. This randomized controlled experimental study included 5-10-year-old boys referred to a pediatric hospital for circumcision between June and September 2019. Randomization was performed using the randomized block design, and the subjects were divided into control (n = 38) and experimental (n = 40) groups. The data were collected using a participant information form, the children's fear scale (CFS), the children's anxiety meter scale (CAM-S), and the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBS); data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 package program. Of the children included in the study, 59% were between the ages of five and six years and 78.2% had no previous hospital experience. Children in the experimental group had significantly lower mean scores of CAM-S and CFS in the pre-and postoperative periods than those in the control group. Also, the mean postoperative WBS score was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Results of this study were similar to those reported previously that VR interventions were effective in reducing fear and anxiety in the preoperative period (Dehghan et al., 2019, Ryu et al., 2018; Olbrechta et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown that patient immersion in interactive VR provides a distraction from painful stimuli and can decrease an individual's perception of the pain (Pouarmand et al., 2018; Chad et al., 2018). Distracting children using a VR intervention before circumcision decreased their anxiety and fear both before and after the surgery, and it was found that the pain symptoms were lower in the postoperative period.", "journal": "Journal of pediatric urology", "year": "2021", "classification": "YES", "confidence": {"reflects_sure": true, "quality_sure": true}}

The aim of the current study was to explore factors associated with discrepancies between depressed patients' Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) self-reports and clinicians' Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) ratings. We first computed discrepancy scores defined as the standardized weighted HAMD-17 total score minus the standardized PHQ-9 total score. To assess correlates of inconsistent scores, results of patients with similar standardized scores were removed (i.e., within ½ standard deviation, n = 270). Positive values indicate underreporting (HAMD-17 > PHQ-9), i.e., the underreporting group (n = 200); and negative discrepancy scores indicate overreporting (PHQ-9 > HAMD-17), i.e., the overreporting group (n = 221). We examined the relationship of demographic, dysfunctional attitudes and personality variables to the discrepancies between self and observer rated depression. There were significant differences in extraversion, psychoticism, neuroticism, dysfunctional attitudes and occupation between the underreporting group and the overreporting group (all p < .05). When controlling for potential confounding variables, being a working professional and having high neuroticism and dysfunctional attitudes were significantly associated with overestimating symptoms of depression (e.g., professional: OR, 2.89; 95% CI, 1.67-5.00; p < .001; high neuroticism: OR, 7.08; 95% CI, 1.47-34.08; p < .001;dysfunctional attitudes: OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; p = .030).

Overall, during COVID-19 lockdown, significantly more time was spent on academic activities, and study grades/output significantly improved. However, the overall effects were of small magnitude, and there was great variability among students, reporting either improved, unchanged or poorer academic functioning. Compared to before COVID-19, the lockdown periods were associated with significantly increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and loneliness, and a significant reduction in optimism and happiness. Significant negative correlations were found between 'performance quality' and stress, 'performance quality' and fatigue, 'study grades/output' and stress, and between 'study grades/output' and fatigue. Correlations of mood and items related to academic interactions were not statistically significant. Differential effects were seen when the data was analyzed according to sex, living situation, and ethnicity, revealing that women, students living alone, and those with a migration background reported that COVID-19 lockdowns had greater negative mood effects and a more negative impact on academic functioning. Poorer sleep quality and reduced quality of life were significantly associated with reduced mood, as well as reduced academic performance quality and role satisfaction. Regression analysis revealed that being young and not having a non-Western migration background were predictors of improved performance quality. However, only being young was a significant predictor of improved study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased levels of stress and fatigue were significant predictors of both reduced performance quality and poorer study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, for the sample as a whole, the transition to online education during the COVID-19 lockdown was judged as having significant positive effects on academic performance. The lockdown periods were associated with significantly reduced mood and reduced social interactions.

In this study, we used post-weaning rats to compare the impact of continuous SI on depressive-like, anxiety-related, and fear-related behaviors and neuronal plasticity in puberty and adulthood. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of lithium on behavioral changes and neuronal plasticity. Continuous SI after weaning induced depressive-like behaviors in puberty; however, in adulthood, depressive-like and anxiety-related behaviors did not increase, but-paradoxically-decreased in comparison with the controls. The decreased expression of neuronal plasticity-related proteins in the hippocampus in puberty was more prominent in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in adulthood. In contrast, SI after weaning tended to decrease fear-related behaviors in puberty, a decrease which was more prominent in adulthood with increased neuronal plasticity-related protein expression in the amygdala. Lithium administration over the last 14 days of the SI-induced period removed the behavioral and expression changes of neuronal plasticity-related proteins observed in puberty and adulthood. Our findings suggest that the extension of the duration of SI from an early developmental stage does not simply worsen depressive-like behaviors; rather, it induces a behavior linked to neuronal plasticity damage.

This randomized, waiting list-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12). Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020, and included participants who completed the intervention (evaluable population). Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay. The primary outcome, depression severity was assessed with the GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID-HAMD) scores at baseline (score of ≥17 required for enrollment) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group, which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group. Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated (QIDS-SR). Of the randomized participants, 24 of 27 (89%) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments. This population had a mean (SD) age of 39.8 (12.2) years, was composed of 16 women (67%), and had a mean (SD) baseline GRID-HAMD score of 22.8 (3.9).

The effect sizes were large at week 5 (Cohen d = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P < .001) and week 8 (Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5-3.7; P < .001). The QIDS-SR documented a rapid decrease in mean (SD) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 (16.7 [3.5] vs 6.3 [4.4]; Cohen d = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-3.5; P < .001), which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow-up (6.0 [5.7]; Cohen d = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.0; P < .001).

Insomnia and short sleep duration, which are typical symptoms of depression, have also been shown to increase the risk for hypertension incidence. Insomnia is associated with increased activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and short sleep duration raises average 24-h blood pressure, which over time could lead to structural adaptations that gradually reset the entire cardiovascular system to operate at an elevated pressure equilibrium. No previous published population studies have examined whether insomnia and sleep duration mediate the relationship between depression and hypertension incidence. We conducted multivariate longitudinal (1982-1992) analyses stratified by age of the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) (n = 4,913) using Cox proportional hazards models.

Moreover, for the first time we included normal anxiety mice (NAB) for comparison. The results confirm that HAB mice show hyperanxious behavior compared to their LAB counterparts, with NAB mice displaying an intermediate anxiety phenotype. Open arm challenge revealed altered c-Fos response in prefrontal-cortical, limbic and hypothalamic areas in HAB mice as compared to LAB mice, and this was similar to the differences observed previously in the HAB/LAB rat lines. In mice, however, additional differential c-Fos response was observed in subregions of the amygdala, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, midbrain and pons. Most of these differences were also seen between HAB and NAB mice, indicating that it is predominately the HAB line showing altered neuronal processing. Hypothalamic hypoactivation detected in LAB versus NAB mice may be associated with their low-anxiety/high-novelty-seeking phenotype.

The most common psychosocial experiences related to HIV infection were fear (36.9%) and helplessness (31.8%). 90.2% of HIV-positive people would not tell others about their disease because of fear of discrimination against family members (42.2%), exclusion by community members (26.9%) and abandonment (23.3%). Discrimination from acquaintances (38.8%) was a main stressor in the HIV-positive individuals' daily life. Most members of HIV-positive individuals' communities expressed negative attitudes: alienation, coldness, aversion and fear. 38.3% of the HIV-positive participants reported that their family members had been discriminated against.

The pattern observed is relevant both to understanding major depression epidemiology and to assessing a possible role for the PHQ-9 as a screening instrument. Random digit dialing was used to select a sample of 3304 community residents. Each respondent was assessed with a baseline interview followed by a series of 6 subsequent follow-up interviews 2 weeks apart. Prevalence was between 2.5% and 3.3% during each interview, consistent with prior reports. The incidence of new episodes was surprisingly high, and many of the episodes were brief. Similarly, high rates of recovery (according to PHQ-9 scoring) were seen early in follow-up but declined subsequently. Episodes of major depression detected by the PHQ-9 tended to be preceded and followed by elevated levels of depressive symptoms. The long-standing episodes of major depression typical of clinical practice appear to represent a minority of episodes occurring in the community. These results suggest that, in general population screening applications, the PHQ-9 will identify many respondents having brief and perhaps self-limited episodes. Although some episodes are characterized by large increases in symptoms, many respondents appear to move above and below the diagnostic threshold as a result of small changes in their symptom levels.

This may be because food insecurity is also related to nonfinancial factors such as the presence of maternal mental health problems. To clarify whether addressing mothers' mental health problems may be a promising strategy for reducing the burden of food insecurity, we tested the hypothesis that low-SES families are especially vulnerable to food insecurity when the mother experiences depression, alcohol or drug abuse, psychosis spectrum disorder, or domestic violence. We used data from a nationally representative cohort of 1116 British families (the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Study). Food insecurity, family SES, maternal mental health and exposure to domestic violence, and children's behavioral outcomes were measured by using validated methods.

In contrast, those with anxiety symptoms differed in measurement of both motives. The impact of non-equivalence was demonstrated with a mediation model in which anxiety and depression predicted drinking motives, which in turn predicted heavy drinking. Incorporation of the partial invariance of the social motives factor attenuated the estimate of the mediated effect of social drinking motives by almost half compared to the estimate with invariance assumed.

Women must balance the economic, emotional and health needs of the household with their own emotional and health needs. The purpose of this study is to explore the depression level of a group of older women in the community in Macau, and to identify factors associated with depression. A descriptive survey. The survey was conducted during the period July and August 2004 in six parishes in Macau; 1042 older people aged 60-98 completed a structured questionnaire. Four main outcome variables were employed in the study: predisposing characteristics, physical, psychosocial and health needs/behaviours outcomes. Among the women, 11.9% (n = 124) had been identified as depressed. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify a model to predict older women who will have depression. The results showed that variables like having hypertension (p = 0.010), a poor social network (p < 0.001), low self-perceived scores on health status (p < 0.001) and ability to meet living costs (p < 0.001), and a low level of ability to do housework (p < 0.001) were significant risk factors for depression. Providing a suitable living environment and improving health conditions for older people may improve depressive symptoms, and maintaining their cognitive function and improving their functional abilities may be crucial for preventing suffering from depressive symptoms. Apart from the findings, these conclusions resonate with recent Macau guidance on managing depression in older women. This stresses the importance of prevention, early detection and stepped care, with more intensive treatment for greater severity of illness and a multifaceted approach to management. It is important to regularly screen for depressive symptoms among older women in the community. Focusing on older women with increasing physical disability and social isolation should help in both the prevention and recognition of onset of depression.

Associations of 12 retrospectively reported CAs with impairment among cases (n=2242) were assessed using multiple regression analysis. Impairment measures included a dichotomous measure of classification in the severe range of impairment on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) and a measure of self-reported number of days out of role due to emotional problems in the past 12 months. CAs were positively and significantly associated with impairment. Predictive effects of CAs on the SDS were particularly pronounced for anxiety disorders and were significant in predicting increased days out of role associated with mood, anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders. Predictive effects persisted throughout the life course and were not accounted for by disorder co-morbidity. CAs associated with maladaptive family functioning (MFF; parental mental illness, substance disorder, criminality, family violence, abuse, neglect) were more consistently associated with impairment than other CAs. The joint effects of co-morbid MFF CAs were significantly subadditive. Simulations suggest that CAs account for 19.6% of severely impairing disorders and 17.4% of days out of role.

Studies demonstrating the pathophysiology of depression in PD and the specific treatment strategies for depression-like symptoms in PD patients are largely lacking, often underrated, under-recognized and, consequently, inadequately/under-treated. Nevertheless, reports suggest that the incidence of depression is approximately 20-30% of PD patients and may precede the onset of motor symptoms.

Depression is a complex disorder with varied symptoms across patients. However, feeling of sadness and decreased motivation, and diminished feeling of pleasure (anhedonia) appear to be core to most depressive pathology. Odorants are potent signals that serve a critical role in social interactions, avoiding danger, and consummatory behaviors. Diminished quality of olfactory function is associated with negative effects on quality of life leading to and aggravating the symptoms of depression. Odor hedonic value (I like or I dislike this smell) is a dominant feature of olfaction and guides approach or avoidance behavior of the odor source. The neural representation of the hedonic value of odorants is carried by the granule cells in the olfactory bulb, which functions to modulate the cortical relay of olfactory information. The granule cells of the olfactory bulb and those of the dentate gyrus are the two major populations of cells in the adult brain with continued neurogenesis into adulthood. In hippocampus, decreased neurogenesis has been linked to development or maintenance of depression symptoms. Here, we hypothesize that chronic mild stress can alter olfactory hedonics through effects on the olfactory bulb neurogenesis, contributing to the broader anhedonia phenotype in stress-associated depression. To test this, mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress and then tested on measures of depressive-like behaviors, odor hedonics, and measures of olfactory neurogenesis. Chronic unpredictable mild stress led to a selective effect on odor hedonics, diminishing attraction to pleasant but not unpleasant odorants, an effect that was accompanied by a specific decrease in adult neurogenesis and of the percentage of adult-born cells responding to pleasant odorants in the olfactory bulb.", "journal": "Frontiers in neuroscience", "year": "2023", "classification": "YES", "confidence": {"reflects_sure": true, "quality_sure": true}}

We use machine learning and statistical analyses to determine the circadian gene variants and clinical features most highly associated with symptoms of seasonality and seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in a deeply phenotyped population sample. We report sex-specific clock gene effects on seasonality and SAD symptoms; genotypic combinations of CLOCK3111/ZBTB20 and PER2/PER3B were significant genetic risk factors for males, and CRY2/PER3C and CRY2/PER3-VNTR were significant risk factors for females. Anxiety, eveningness, and increasing age were significant clinical risk factors for seasonality and SAD for females. Protective factors for SAD symptoms (in females only) included single gene variants: CRY1-GG and PER3-VNTR-4,5. Clock gene effects were partially or fully mediated by diurnal preference or chronotype, suggesting multiple indirect effects of clock genes on seasonality symptoms. Interestingly, protective effects of CRY1-GG, PER3-VNTR-4,5, and ZBTB20 genotypes on seasonality and depression were not mediated by chronotype, suggesting some clock variants have direct effects on depressive symptoms related to SAD. Our results support previous links between CRY2, PER2, and ZBTB20 genes and identify novel links for CLOCK and PER3 with symptoms of seasonality and SAD. Our findings reinforce the sex-specific nature of circadian clock influences on seasonality and SAD and underscore the multiple pathways by which clock variants affect downstream mood pathways via direct and indirect mechanisms.", "journal": "Biology", "year": "2023", "classification": "YES", "confidence": {"reflects_sure": true, "quality_sure": true}}

While individuals with CF commonly endure uncomfortable and/or distressing medical procedures, procedural anxiety among children and adolescents with CF has received little research attention. This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of procedural anxiety among individuals with CF aged 6-18 and their parents. Eighty-nine parents of children with CF completed surveys examining child procedural anxiety, anxiety, and health behaviors (including treatment adherence); and parent vicarious procedural anxiety. Seventy-five percent of participants rated at least one CF-related procedure as \"extremely\" anxiety-inducing for their child. Parental vicarious procedural anxiety was reported in 80.9% of participants. Procedural anxiety significantly correlated with child anxiety, treatment-resistive behaviors, and parent-vicarious procedural anxiety. Procedural anxiety was associated with younger age and frequency of distressing procedures, but not with forced expiratory volume in 1 s, body mass index, hospitalizations, or exposure to general anesthesia. Procedural anxiety is common among children, adolescents, and caregivers, and is associated with child anxiety and treatment resistance, emphasizing the importance of screening and interventions for procedural anxiety as part of routine CF care from early childhood.

Levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl content (CC) were estimated in patients' serum samples. Serum antibodies against <i>in vitro</i> hydroxyl radical (<sup>•</sup>OH) modified pDNA (<sup>•</sup>OH-pDNA-Abs) were estimated using direct binding and inhibition ELISA. Cancer patients showed increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6) and oxidative stress markers (MDA and CC levels), which were further significantly enhanced in cancer patients with depression compared to normal healthy (NH) individuals. Increased levels of <sup>•</sup>OH-pDNA-Abs were detected in breast cancer (0.506 ± 0.063) and prostate cancer (0.441 ± 0.066) patients compared to NH subjects. Serum antibodies were found to be significantly elevated in BC patients with depression (BCD) (0.698 ± 0.078) and prostate cancer patients with depression (PCD) (0.636 ± 0.058).

Accordingly, we conducted an ancillary investigation of the PTSC intervention on depression to ascertain its impact on reduced depressive symptoms in the study population. Depressive symptoms were measured using an adapted version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised (CES-D-10). We used unadjusted and adjusted fixed effect models. Data for this study came from the PTSC-RCT. We collected data between 2017 and 2018 in Washington, DC. We used a balanced analytical sample of 172 African American, English-speaking women between 40 to 75 years old with uncontrolled hypertension. The intervention group participated in a 2-h, peer-based support group once a week for 13 weeks. A trained PTSC facilitator facilitated sessions with experts who delivered content on various topics, including psychosocial wellness (e.g., stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety management, and self-esteem), physical health (e.g., hypertension, inflammation, and heart disease), physical activity, and healthy nutrition. Results from the fixed-effects models indicated that participants in the PTSC program exhibited a greater reduction in CES-D-10 score at three months (Coeff: -1.99, 95% CI: -3.49, -0.49) and at 15 months (Coeff: -2.38, 95% CI: -3.94, -0.83), as compared to those in the control group.

Connexin 43 (CX43), the main type of connexins expressed in astrocytes, has been indicated to participate in depression disorders. Nevertheless, the role of CX43 in MS-induced cognitive impairment and astrocyte dysfunction is unclear. Neonatal C57BL/6 mice were exposed to MS to mimic early life stress. Adeno-associated virus carrying CX43 was inoculated into mice for CX43 overexpression. Sucrose preference test, forced swim test and Morris water maze were performed for evaluating depression-like behaviors and spatial learning and memory of mice in adulthood. Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was conducted to detect CX43 mRNA expression in mouse brain. Immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were used for measuring expression levels of astrocytic markers in murine hippocampal dentate gyrus. The results showed that overexpressing CX43 attenuated MS exposure-induced depression-like behaviors and decrease in spatial learning and memory in mice.

As most studies of this relationship are small and do not account for use of psychotropic drugs (PTDs), we explored the relations of the gut microbiome with several internalizing disorders, while adjusting for PTDs and other relevant medications, in 7,656 Lifelines participants from the Northern Netherlands (5,522 controls and 491 participants with at least one internalizing disorder). Disorders included dysthymia, major depressive disorder (MDD), any depressive disorder (AnyDep: dysthymia or MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and any anxiety disorder (AnyAnx: GAD, social phobia and panic disorder). Compared to controls, 17 species were associated with depressive disorders and 3 were associated with anxiety disorders. Around 90% of these associations remained significant (FDR <0.05) after adjustment for PTD use, suggesting that the disorders, not PTD use, drove these associations. Negative associations were observed for the butyrate-producing bacteria <i>Ruminococcus bromii</i> in participants with AnyDep and for <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i> in AnyAnx participants, along with many others. Tryptophan and glutamate synthesis modules and the 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid synthesis module (related to dopamine metabolism) were negatively associated with MDD and/or dysthymia. After additional adjustment for functional gastrointestinal disorders and irritable bowel syndrome, these relations remained either statistically (FDR <0.05) or nominally (<i>P</i> < 0.05) significant. Overall, multiple bacterial species and functional modules were associated with internalizing disorders, including gut - brain relevant components, while associations to PTD use were moderate.
