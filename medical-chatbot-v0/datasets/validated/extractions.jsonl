We investigate if CSE could attenuate anxiety-like behaviors induced by novelty and alarm substance exposures in zebrafish. Adult zebrafish were injected with vehicle, clonazepam, or CSE (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg) and submitted to novel tank test. At the end, saline or alarm substance was added and anxiety-like responses were recorded. Twenty-four hours after, fish were submitted to the light/dark test. Novelty associated with alarm substance exposure decreased distance traveled and total time mobile in novel tank, and CSE (at 50 and 100 mg/kg) prevented these alterations similarly to clonazepam. Alarm substance reduced the time spent in white compartment (<i>p</i> = 0.0193 as compared with vehicle group). Clonazepam and CSE prevented this anxiogenic effect of alarm substance.

There are numerous suicide-related findings pertaining to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), caudate nucleus and thalamus, which form a cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit responsible for executive function and working memory. An aberrant CSTC circuitry is hypothesized to be implicated in depressed patients with a high suicidal risk. 27 MDD patients were assessed with the Nurses Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR), following which 14 patients were classified into a high suicide risk group (NGASR ≥ 12) and 13 patients were assigned to a low suicide risk group (NGASR < 6). All 27 patients were enrolled with 25 healthy controls for resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG).

There was a significantly lower alpha-to-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between the right caudate and left thalamus in high-risk suicide group compared to both the low-risk suicide group and healthy controls. The presence of a weaker coupling between the right caudate and left thalamus is indicative of a caudothalamic abnormality in suicidally depressed patients.

Limited evidence exists regarding the screening accuracy of the PHQ-2 in childbearing women. An alternative case-identification method may be more sensitive for perinatal women. We aimed to [1] evaluate the screening accuracy of the PHQ-2 during the perinatal period using two case-identification methods, and [2] measure the variability of accuracy over four time-points during pregnancy and postpartum. A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted with 309 consecutive women who completed the PHQ-2 and EPDS during pregnancy (booking, 36-weeks) and postpartum (6-, 26-weeks). EPDS was the reference standard using cut-off scores for 'at least probable minor depression' during pregnancy (≥ 13) and postpartum (≥ 10) and for 'probable major depression' during pregnancy (≥ 15) and postpartum (≥ 13). PHQ-2 was analysed using two methods: [1] scored (cut-points ≥ 2 and ≥ 3), [2] dichotomous yes/no (positive response to either question) against EPDS cut-points for at least probable minor and probable major depression. Receiver operating characteristic analyses determined accuracy. Probable major depression: Over four timepoints PHQ-2 ≥ 3 revealed lowest sensitivity (36-79%) but highest specificity (94-98%). An alternative case-identification method revealed high sensitivity (93-100%), but lowest specificity (58-71%). Minor depression: PHQ-2 ≥ 3 revealed the lowest sensitivity (19-50%) but highest specificity (95-98%). An alternative case-identification method revealed the highest sensitivity (81-100%) and moderate specificity (60-74%). Recommended method of case-identification (PHQ-2 ≥ 3) missed an unacceptable number of women at-risk of depression. As a clinical decision-making tool, an alternative, dichotomous method maximized case-identification and is recommended. Further, the literature identified inconsistent reporting of the PHQ-2 and the alternative case-identification method hindering the ability to synthesise data. The future use and reporting of consistent question wording and response format will improve outcome reporting and synthesis.

Elevation in mood and sociality in humans has been observed following propofol-induced anesthesia. Other authors reported an open-label study of repeated dosing of propofol in treatment-resistant depression in which several patients experienced sustained improvement. Recently, we reported that in a rodent model of despair, a forced swim test, 45 minutes after administration of 50 mg/kg propofol, immobility time was significantly reduced.

A limitation of the study is that 27% of baseline participants did not complete the 17-month outcome assessment.

However, it is unknown about what is unfolding in the moment that is driving depression-related drinking in solitary contexts. Accordingly, we used an experimental study to examine if shame mediated the association between depression and in-lab alcohol craving. Emerging adults (N = 80) completed a shame induction followed by an alcohol cue exposure in either a solitary or social condition. We used moderated mediation to test hypotheses. Consistent with hypotheses, conditional indirect effects supported the mediation of depression and alcohol craving through shame among those in the solitary condition, but not in the social condition.

We followed patients for up to five years regarding hospital admissions with depression and performed adjusted Cox regression analyses calculating hazard rate ratios (HRR) including 95%-confidence intervals (CI) to test the association between medical diseases and depression admission following the index depressive episode. Among 117,585 patients with depression (444,696 person-years follow-up), any prior medical hospital contact (N = 114,206; 97.1%) was associated with increased risks of admission for depression among individuals aged 18-30 (HRR=1.50; 95%CI=1.15-1.95), 31-65 (HRR=1.69; 95%CI=1.28-2.21), and >65 years (HRR=1.38; 95%CI=1.10-1.75), fitting a dose-response relationship (p<0.005) with increasing number of prior medical diseases among those aged <65. All specific medical diseases were associated with increased risks of admission for depression, particularly among individuals aged<65 (HRR ranging from 1.57 to 2.38). Drug prescriptions and medical hospital contacts in the year before the depression diagnosis were associated with reduced risks of admission. The medical load seems to be associated with an increased risk for depression admission, particularly among individuals aged <65. The lower risk for people in medical care during the previous year may indicate better compliance and care/treatment.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

The present study aimed to explore the potential correlations between gut microbiota and PPD. In this study, 57 participants were enrolled, in which fecal samples of 28 patients with PPD and 16 healthy controls (HCs) were collected and then analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The results showed that diversity and composition of gut microbial communities were partly different between PPD patients and HCs. The relative abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i> phyla was lower in PPD patients. The levels of several predominant genera were significantly different between PPD patients and HCs. More importantly, the PPD patients experienced reduced levels of <i>Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Butyricicoccus</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, as well as increased levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> family. In addition, a correlation was observed between levels of <i>Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospiraceae, Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Tyzzerella.3</i> and the severity of depressive symptoms. Various kinds of bacteria, such as <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, were found to be associated with levels of sex hormones. This study indicated the correlation between gut microbiota and PPD, and gut microbiota-based biomarkers may be helpful for the diagnosis and treatment of PPD patients. However, further studies need to be conducted to clarify the cause-effect relationship between PPD patients and gut microbiota and to highlight the suitability of gut microbiome as a biomarker.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

Anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. It is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during the COVID pandemic, but data are limited. During the first month of government mandated lockdown, we administered an anxiety assessment via telephone among PLHIV registered for care at a publicly funded antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Generalized anxiety was defined as GAD-7 score ≥10. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were compared by anxiety status (GAD-7 score≥10 vs GAD-7 score<10). Qualitative responses to an open-ended question about causes of concern were evaluated using thematic analysis. Among 167 PLHIV, median age was 44 years (IQR 40-50); the majority were cisgender women (60%) and had a monthly family income <200 USD (81%). Prior history of tuberculosis and other comorbidities were observed in 38% and 27%, respectively. Overall, prevalence of generalized anxiety was 25% (n=41). PLHIV with GAD-7 score ≥10 had fewer remaining doses of ART than those with lower GAD-7 scores (p=0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. The burden of anxiety was high during COVID lockdown in our population of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV in Pune and appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. The burden of anxiety among PLHIV will likely increase with the worsening pandemic in India, as sources of anxiety are expected to persist.

I relate my experiences to a growing body of research, which have important implications for improving care. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH NURSING?: Healthcare professionals should make patients aware of potential withdrawal symptoms they may experience before they wean off antidepressants; regularly review their progress; consider helping them access psychological support whilst weaning off; and engage in open and collaborative conversations with patients throughout. Clinical guidance needs to be updated to provide appropriate evidence-based information/advice/recommendations for how best to support patients when coming off of antidepressants. ABSTRACT: A significant proportion of the UK population are taking antidepressants, and have been taking them for at least a year. Clinical guidelines have controversially stated that withdrawal symptoms when weaning off antidepressants are mild and resolve after one week, with the proviso that they can be severe only if the drug is stopped abruptly. However, recent evidence suggests this is not the case. I describe my own experiences of tapering the dose of my antidepressants after several years of taking them. I describe my encounters with healthcare professionals throughout this period, detailing conflicting advice I have received, along with describing the mental and physical withdrawal symptoms I have experienced. My experiences relate to a growing body of research, which have important implications for improving care. Potential learning outcomes are that healthcare professionals should make patients aware of potential withdrawal symptoms they may experience before they wean off antidepressants; regularly review their progress; consider helping them access psychological support whilst weaning off; and engage in open and collaborative conversations with patients throughout the process. Clinical guidance needs to be updated to provide appropriate evidence-based information, advice, and recommendations for how best to support patients when coming off of antidepressants.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the use of an alternative person-centered approach, group iterative multiple model estimation (GIMME), to model change over time that focuses on the interdependence of daily student motivation levels and teacher feedback and their relations to student outcomes over time. Specifically, we used GIMME to model person level responses to negative teacher feedback regarding students' next day motivational ratings using data from 58 5th grade students participating in a study of the impact of the self-monitoring and regulation training strategy (SMARTS). Results identified a set of SMARTS students whose daily readiness aligned with high rates of self and teacher agreement regarding ongoing performance ratings. However, results identified a group of students whose daily motivation and readiness for change was adversely impacted by negative teacher feedback the day before. For these students, they were more likely than their peers to experience high levels of depression and internalization scores. Motivationally oriented practice suggestions for providing feedback to students who may be sensitive to this type of feedback and research implications of these findings are discussed.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

A multivariate 2-part regression model was used to determine incremental economic burden, health care sector utilization, and expenditures. Of 7279 ophthalmic patients, 1123 (15.43%) were diagnosed with depression (mean expenditures $17,017.25 ± $2019.13) and 6156 patients (84.57%) without depression (mean expenditures $9924.50 ± $692.94). Patients with depression were more likely to be female, white, lower income, use Medicare/Medicaid, and to have comorbidities (P < .001). These patients faced $5894.86 (95% confidence interval $4222.33-$7348.36, P < .001) in incremental economic expenditures because of depression, resulting in an additional $22.4 billion annually when extrapolating nationally. These patients had higher utilization for all health care service sectors (P < .025 for all) and higher expenditures for outpatient (P = .022) and prescription medications (P = .029) when adjusted for sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Depression was responsible for 6.9% of inpatient admissions (the second-leading cause) for this cohort of patients. Ophthalmic patients with depression had a higher incremental economic burden and health care service sector utilization and expenditures. Patients with ophthalmic pathologies, including dry eye syndrome, blindness, and retinopathies, were more likely to be depressed. As psychiatric and ophthalmic conditions may have a bidirectional relationship, exacerbating disease severity and financial burden for patients with both, ophthalmologists may need to be more cognizant of the burden of depression among patients.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

This paper aimed to identify existing evidence on psychological symptoms and their associated factors among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on interventions to effectively manage these symptoms. Articles related to the prevalence, the risk factors and interventions of psychological symptoms among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during COVID-19 published between December 2019 and August 2020 were searched in two English (PubMed and Embase) and two Chinese (CNKI and Wan Fang Data) databases. A total of 180 studies were identified, and 18 studies were included in the review after removing duplicates and screening for relevancy. The results suggest that patients with cancer in the Chinese Mainland have suffered psychological pressure during COVID-19, with a high prevalence of psychological distress, depression and anxiety reported across most of the reviewed studies. Pandemic-related factors such as treatment discontinuation and worry about being infected are associated with these symptoms. Nurses may help to relieve these symptoms by identifying stressors, providing relevant information through mass and social media and referring patients to specialists for psychological support.

We first computed discrepancy scores defined as the standardized weighted HAMD-17 total score minus the standardized PHQ-9 total score. To assess correlates of inconsistent scores, results of patients with similar standardized scores were removed (i.e., within ½ standard deviation, n = 270). Positive values indicate underreporting (HAMD-17 > PHQ-9), i.e., the underreporting group (n = 200); and negative discrepancy scores indicate overreporting (PHQ-9 > HAMD-17), i.e., the overreporting group (n = 221).

There were significant differences in extraversion, psychoticism, neuroticism, dysfunctional attitudes and occupation between the underreporting group and the overreporting group (all p < .05).

A retrospective analysis examining the impact of patient age on the speed and durability of ketamine's antidepressant effects in 49 veterans receiving serial intravenous ketamine infusions for TRD. The relationship between age and percent change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores was compared across six serial ketamine infusions (twice-weekly for 3 weeks) using a linear-mixed model. A significant Age-X-Infusion number interaction (F = 3.01, p = .0274) indicated that the relationship between age and treatment response depended on infusion number. Follow-up tests showed that younger age significantly predicted greater clinical improvement at infusion #4 (t = 3.02, p = .004); this relationship was attenuated at infusion #5 (t = 1.95, p = .057) and was absent at infusion #6. Age was not a significant predictor of treatment durability, defined as percent change in BDI-II 3 weeks following infusion #6. These data preliminarily suggest that younger age is associated with a faster response over six serial ketamine infusions; by infusion #6 and subsequent weeks of clinical follow-up, age no longer predicts ketamine's antidepressant activity.

A total of <i>n</i> = 341 participants completed an online survey including questions on mood and academic functioning, assessed retrospectively for before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, during COVID-19 lockdown, significantly more time was spent on academic activities, and study grades/output significantly improved. However, the overall effects were of small magnitude, and there was great variability among students, reporting either improved, unchanged or poorer academic functioning. Compared to before COVID-19, the lockdown periods were associated with significantly increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and loneliness, and a significant reduction in optimism and happiness. Significant negative correlations were found between 'performance quality' and stress, 'performance quality' and fatigue, 'study grades/output' and stress, and between 'study grades/output' and fatigue. Correlations of mood and items related to academic interactions were not statistically significant. Differential effects were seen when the data was analyzed according to sex, living situation, and ethnicity, revealing that women, students living alone, and those with a migration background reported that COVID-19 lockdowns had greater negative mood effects and a more negative impact on academic functioning. Poorer sleep quality and reduced quality of life were significantly associated with reduced mood, as well as reduced academic performance quality and role satisfaction. Regression analysis revealed that being young and not having a non-Western migration background were predictors of improved performance quality. However, only being young was a significant predictor of improved study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased levels of stress and fatigue were significant predictors of both reduced performance quality and poorer study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, for the sample as a whole, the transition to online education during the COVID-19 lockdown was judged as having significant positive effects on academic performance. The lockdown periods were associated with significantly reduced mood and reduced social interactions.

One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from specialized early intervention program for first-episode psychosis in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year early intervention service, and underwent 1-year randomized controlled trial as well as 2-year post-randomized controlled trial follow-up (i.e. 3-year follow-up). Assessments on premorbid adjustment, onset profile, psychopathology, functioning and treatment characteristics were conducted. Individual class membership of subjective quality of life trajectory derived from growth mixing modeling was based on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey mental component summary scores measured at four different time-points (baseline, 1, 2 and 3 years) among 142 participants across 3-year follow-up. Three distinct subjective quality of life trajectories were identified including higher-improving (68.3%, <i>n</i> = 97), lower-stable (24.6%, <i>n</i> = 35) and deteriorating (7%, <i>n</i> = 10) trajectories. Age of onset; duration of untreated psychosis; depressive, positive and negative symptoms; and intervention condition were significantly different between good (higher-improving trajectory) and poor (combined lower-stable and deteriorating trajectories) trajectory groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that younger age of onset, more severe depression and receipt of step-down care independently predicted poor subjective quality of life trajectory. Approximately one-third of patients displayed poor subjective quality of life trajectory in the early phase of psychotic illness. Our results affirm depression as a critical determinant of prospective subjective quality of life and underscores positive effect of extended early intervention on sustained subjective quality of life improvement. Further longitudinal research is warranted to facilitate better characterization of subjective quality of life course patterns and development of targeted intervention to optimize subjective quality of life in patients with early psychosis.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis, not currently using antidepressant medications, and without histories of psychotic disorder, serious suicide attempt, or hospitalization were eligible to participate. Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019, and the 4-week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019. A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group (n = 15) or delayed treatment condition group (waiting list control condition; n = 12).

However, PD patients experience a multitude of debilitating non-motor symptoms, including depression, which may have deleteriously detrimental effects on life. Depression is multifactorial and exhibits a bimodal progression in PD, but its underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Studies demonstrating the pathophysiology of depression in PD and the specific treatment strategies for depression-like symptoms in PD patients are largely lacking, often underrated, under-recognized and, consequently, inadequately/under-treated. Nevertheless, reports suggest that the incidence of depression is approximately 20-30% of PD patients and may precede the onset of motor symptoms. Diagnosing depression in PD becomes difficult due to the clinical overlap in symptomatology between the two diseases, and the nigrostriatal dysfunction alone is insufficient to explain depressive symptoms in PD. Therefore, the current study provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of depression in PD and new insights into developing current antidepressant strategies to treat depression in PD. This review will identify and understand the molecular pathological mechanisms of depression in PD that will fundamentally help tailoring therapeutic interventions for depressive symptoms in PD.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

We also examined whether depression and anxiety can mediate the relationship between emotion regulation strategies and caregiving helplessness. A sample of 552 healthy Turkish mothers (<i>MAge</i> = 32.11) with 1-4 year old healthy children (<i>MAge</i> = 1.51) replied to advertisements we shared face-to-face and filled out a pack of questionnaires including a demographic form, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Brief Symptom Inventory and Caregiving Helplessness Questionnaire. A series of path analysis were conducted to reveal the association between emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and emotional suppression), depression and anxiety symptoms, and caregiving helplessness. After controlling for socio-economic status (SES), maternal anxiety but not maternal depression positively predicted caregiving helplessnes. Unlike cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression positively predicted caregiving helplessness. SES had an indirect effect (via suppression) on caregiving helplessness on caregiving helplessness. In toddlerhood, maternal anxiety rather than depression, and expressive supression rather than cogntivie reappraisal could be potential risk factors for caregiving helplessness. Thus, these can be critical target areas for effective early interventions.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

The distribution of medical colleges is disproportionately concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural populations without quality health care. The mental well-being of physicians is a growing concern, with studies indicating high levels of burnout, stress, and depression among healthcare workers, worsened by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Rising suicide rates among medical professionals highlight the severity of burnout and depression in the healthcare sector. Factors contributing to this crisis include inadequate recruitment in government hospitals, a shortage of healthcare professionals, and inefficiencies in resource distribution. Attacks on physicians have become alarmingly frequent, necessitating comprehensive studies to understand the challenges faced by different specialties and the impact of rural versus urban settings. To address these issues, prompt filling of vacant positions in government hospitals and prioritizing physicians' mental health is crucial. The government should offer competitive salaries, effective management, and supportive working environments to combat the brain drain. Initiatives inspiring professionals to stay in Nepal, along with maintaining the National Health Insurance Program and controlling healthcare privatization, are necessary. Resilience training, professional programs, and improved infrastructure in government medical colleges are vital. This crisis demands global attention and a national study to evaluate burnout, depression, and suicide among healthcare professionals. By addressing these challenges and supporting the well-being of healthcare workers, Nepal can work toward a sustainable healthcare system that provides quality care for all.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

Data are from an ongoing, longitudinal, cohort study (n = 2234). Data were set up in an accelerated longitudinal design from age 17 to 24 years.

Amongst inhibited preschool children, we aimed to predict each of clinical child anxiety and depressive problems in mid childhood from a broad range of potential risks (demographics, traumatic events and broader recent stressors, parents' well-being, and parenting practices). This study is based on data from a wider population trial of Cool Little Kids that recruited a representative sample of inhibited preschool children enrolled in their year before starting school. In 2011-2012, an inhibition screen was universally distributed to parents of children in their year before school (age 4 years) across eight diverse government areas in Melbourne, Australia. Participants were 545 parents of inhibited preschoolers (78% uptake, 545/703) who were followed to mid childhood (three annual waves 2015-2017, age 7-10 years) with 84% retention (456/545). Parents completed questionnaires spanning child ages 4-10 years, along with diagnostic interviews for child anxiety. Children also completed questionnaires in mid childhood. The questionnaires encompassed a variety of potential risks including sociodemographics, traumatic events, recent life stressors, parent wellbeing and parenting practices. In mid childhood, 57% (246/430) of inhibited preschoolers had a clinical level of anxiety problems while 22% (95/432) had depressive problems (by one or more sources). The aetiology analyses highlighted parent distress and parenting practices (overinvolved/protective, harsh discipline) as key predictors of inhibited preschoolers' internalising problems by mid childhood.

Depression is a complex disorder with varied symptoms across patients. However, feeling of sadness and decreased motivation, and diminished feeling of pleasure (anhedonia) appear to be core to most depressive pathology. Odorants are potent signals that serve a critical role in social interactions, avoiding danger, and consummatory behaviors. Diminished quality of olfactory function is associated with negative effects on quality of life leading to and aggravating the symptoms of depression. Odor hedonic value (I like or I dislike this smell) is a dominant feature of olfaction and guides approach or avoidance behavior of the odor source. The neural representation of the hedonic value of odorants is carried by the granule cells in the olfactory bulb, which functions to modulate the cortical relay of olfactory information. The granule cells of the olfactory bulb and those of the dentate gyrus are the two major populations of cells in the adult brain with continued neurogenesis into adulthood. In hippocampus, decreased neurogenesis has been linked to development or maintenance of depression symptoms. Here, we hypothesize that chronic mild stress can alter olfactory hedonics through effects on the olfactory bulb neurogenesis, contributing to the broader anhedonia phenotype in stress-associated depression. To test this, mice were subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress and then tested on measures of depressive-like behaviors, odor hedonics, and measures of olfactory neurogenesis. Chronic unpredictable mild stress led to a selective effect on odor hedonics, diminishing attraction to pleasant but not unpleasant odorants, an effect that was accompanied by a specific decrease in adult neurogenesis and of the percentage of adult-born cells responding to pleasant odorants in the olfactory bulb.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

Data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS), 2014 and 2015. CHARLS is a nationally representative survey covering 28 provinces in China. CHARLS used the probabilities proportional to size (PPS) sampling method and involved 450 villages/resident committees, 150 counties/districts and 12,400 households. A total of 5113 urban dwellers born earlier than 1971 (aged 25 years old and above at the start of the SOE reform, 1995) were involved. Using the province-level  economic loss from the layoffs, we examined the impact of economic insecurity exposure on the score of depressive symptoms using a difference-in-differences model (DID). Individuals with economic insecurity exposure had a significantly increased risk of higher depressive symptoms scores, in which a 1 percentage point increase in expected economic loss would increase the CESD-10 score by 0.10. For an individual at the median distribution (CESD-10 = 5), this implies a shift to the 58th percentile (CESD-10 = 6). Given that the average intensity of expected economic loss is 10.22% and the mean CESD-10 is 6.92, exposure to the SOE reform led to an average increase in the CESD-10 score by 1.02 and by at least 14.74%. The heterogeneity analyses showed that the role of SOE reform in depressive symptoms scores was robust in both female and male groups and groups with different educational attainment. Economic insecurity exposure increased the depressive symptoms score later in life in the context of China. Programs, such as adequate unemployment insurance benefits, can protect individuals against the risk of financial loss, thereby reducing their negative impact on depressive symptoms. Providing mental symptoms surveillance and psychological counseling to those experienced at a time of great uncertainty is important for preventing depression in times of economic insecurity.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

This study examined the role of aging in anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and cognition behaviours in aged HINT1 KO mice compared with young HINT1 KO mice and their wild-type littermates, along with a number of molecular biological methods. In a battery of behavioural tests, aged wild-type mice showed increased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and decreased cognitive performance, along with lower expression levels of glutathione peroxidase, enhanced amount of malondialdehyde, and decreased expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine kinase B in the hippocampus and PFC compared to young wild-type mice. HINT1 KO mice showed reduced anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours and enhanced cognitive performance compared to age-matched wild-type mice.

The present study tested whether enhancements in proactive control occurring during adolescence may reduce risk for anxiety among youth with a history of BI. Participants included 185 adolescents (56% female) whose temperament was assessed during toddlerhood. In adolescence, participants completed anxiety assessments and an AX Continuous Performance Test (AX-CPT) to assess cognitive control strategy. Both assessments were administered at age 13 years and again at 15 years. Latent change score modeling revealed that, on average, participants increasingly used proactive control strategies and experienced worsening anxiety from age 13-15 years. Early BI was associated with a smaller anxiety increase from 13-15 years, but only among participants whose proactive control skills improved at mean or greater rates. The present findings suggest that greater proactive control development during adolescence protects youth with high BI from age-related increases in anxiety.

The odds of developing depression were increased for current short-term use of any β-blocker (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72-2.12), whereas current long-term use was not associated with the risk of depression compared with never use. The elevated risk of depression among short-term users was mostly confined to propranolol users with a neuropsychiatric disorder (aOR 6.33, 95% CI 5.16-7.76), while propranolol users with a cardiovascular indication were only at marginally increased risk of depression (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.14-1.82).

Adolescents in Brazil ages 14 to 16 years were classified into low-risk, high-risk, and depressed groups using a clinical assessment and composite risk score that integrates 11 sociodemographic risk variables.

Adolescents with depression showed greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex compared with the 2 risk groups and greater dorsal ACC global efficiency than the low-risk group. Adolescents with depression also showed reduced local efficiency and a lower clustering coefficient of the subgenual ACC compared with the 2 risk groups. The high-risk group also showed a lower subgenual ACC clustering coefficient relative to the low-risk group.

Immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus (ΔFosB, BDNF, and 8OHDG) and hypothalamus (ΔFosB) was also performed. The Isolated group showed impaired memory along with a decrease in hippocampal ΔFosB at dentate gyrus and in BDNF at CA3. Food intake was also affected, but the direction depended on how it was measured in the Social group (individually or in the group) with no alteration in ΔFosB at the hypothalamus. Physical activity parameters increased with chronic isolation, but in the light cycle (inactive phase), with some evidence of anxiety-like behaviour. Future studies should better explore the timepoint at which the alterations found begin.

We have recently described a novel rat model of maternal MDD with a Peripartum Onset. Exposure to pre-gestational chronic mild stress (CMS) with repeated restrain resulted in maternal depressive-like behavior and impacted offspring's neurodevelopment. The present study examined gender differences in short- vs. long-term neurodevelopmental impact of pre-gestational maternal stress. Stress response was assessed in Sprague Dawley CMS-exposed dams (n=7) by metabolic, hormonal, and behavioral changes and compared to controls dams (n=7). Short-term impact of maternal stress on offspring was examined in terms of metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and behavioral tests in male (n=40) and female (n=35) adolescent offspring on a postnatal day (PD) 48; the long-term impact was assessed in adult male (n=13) and female (n=12) offspring on PD 225. Brain tissue was collected from adolescent and adult offspring for biochemical analysis. Maternal stress was associated with decreased body weight and increased urinary corticosterone during the pre-pregnancy period, but depressive-like behavior was delayed until later in pregnancy. No significant neurodevelopmental changes in suckling male or female offspring derived from the stress-exposed dams were observed. However, adolescent male and female offspring of stress-exposed dams displayed an increased depressive-like behavior and gender-dependent increase in anxiety-like behavior in female offspring. These changes were associated with a brain-region-specific increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein and BDNF receptor (TrkB) mRNA in males.

The current study evaluated the potential of a computerized programme aimed at improving affective control, a mechanistic target involved in both risk and maintenance of depression. In a first phase the cognitive profiles of 48 depressed individuals (mean age: 39 years, 75 % female) were compared to cognitive functioning in 16 never-depressed individuals (mean age: 31 years, 56 % female).

However, iCBT is still underutilized in clinical contexts, such as primary care. In order to achieve the effective implementation of these protocols, more studies in ecological settings are needed. The Unified Protocol (UP) is a transdiagnostic CBT protocol for the treatment of emotional disorders, which includes depression, anxiety and related disorders, that has shown its efficacy across different contexts and populations. An internet-based UP (iUP) programme has recently been developed as an emerging internet-based treatment for emotional disorders. However, the internet-delivered version of the UP (iUP) has not yet been examined empirically. The current project seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the iUP as a treatment for depression, anxiety and related emotional disorders in a primary care public health setting. The current study will employ a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design. Participants will be randomly assigned to (a) the internet-based Unified Protocol (iUP), or (b) enhanced waiting list control (eWLC). Randomization will follow a 2:1 allocation ratio, with sample size calculations suggesting a required sample of 120 (iUP=80; eWLC=40). The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will be used for assessing potential participants. The Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) and the Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) as well as other standardized questionnaires will be used for assessments at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks from baseline and for the iUP condition during the follow-up. Combining the advantages of a transdiagnostic treatment with an online delivery format may have the potential to significantly lower the burden of emotional disorders in public health primary care setting. Anxiety and depression, often comorbid, are the most prevalent psychological disorders in primary care. Because the iUP allows for the treatment of different disorders and comorbidity, this treatment could represent an adequate choice for patients that demand mental health care in a primary care setting.

Although numerous clinical descriptions of supportive psychotherapy exist, its use is reportedly widespread, and several supportive psychotherapies have been used in psychotherapy trials, BSP is the first and sole supportive psychotherapy manualized for research. BSP was designed as a nondirective, affect-focused, bare-bones common-factors treatment. Collecting data from the nine randomized controlled trials involving BSP, eight of them published, the author presents a narrative summary of findings. Eight trials addressed mood disorders and one addressed social anxiety disorder. Sample size varied. Most BSP trials resulted in \"dead heat\" comparable outcomes. BSP generally showed large effect sizes for improvement on the primary outcome variable (range d=0.62-1.01). Delivering it won over some therapists from exposure-based backgrounds. Despite its perennial role as an unfavored control condition, BSP held its own in competition with more symptom-focused therapies, usually producing a dead-heat outcome. The findings indicate the importance of psychotherapeutic common factors and the potency of BSP as an active treatment condition.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

Empirical work on perceived dignity is relatively scant, but it stands to reason that one source of dignity might be gathered through religion/spirituality, especially through one's relationship with God or a divine power. In this study, we test whether attachment to God may protect against the hypothesized negative mental health consequences of having low perceptions of dignity. Using nationally representative data from the 2017 Baylor Religion Survey (N = 1375), we find that lower perceptions of dignity were associated with higher depression and anxiety. We found that for respondents with low self-perceptions of dignity, stronger feelings of secure attachment to God attenuated (weakened) the otherwise positive association between low dignity and greater depression and anxiety. Taken together, a secure attachment to God could lead believers to confront challenges and problems, including one's dignity being undermined, with confidence and security.

The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depression in patients with CLTI, its association on major amputation and all-cause mortality, and whether medical antidepressant treatment is associated with improvement in these outcomes in patients with depression. A retrospective review of all adult patients (≥18 years old) diagnosed with CLTI from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2018, at a single academic medical center was performed. Collected data included patient demographics, comorbidities, and diagnosis of depression within 6 months of initial CLTI diagnosis. We also collected data on use of antidepressant medications. Outcomes evaluated were need for major lower extremity amputation and all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models estimated the adjusted effects of comorbid depression and antidepressant medication use on major amputation and all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier survival curves illustrated the probabilities of survival and limb salvage over time, stratified by diagnosis of comorbid depression. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models estimated the adjusted effects of comorbid depression on time to major amputation and all-cause mortality, and the adjusted effect of antidepressant treatment on time to all-cause mortality. A total of 2987 patients with CLTI were identified. Mean age was 68.6 years (standard deviation, 12.9 years); 56.5% were male, and 43.5% were female. Comorbid depression within 6 months of CLTI diagnosis was present in 7.1% of the cohort (212 patients). In multivariable analysis, comorbid depression was associated with a 68% increase in the odds of major amputation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.37; P < .01), a 164% increase in the odds of all-cause mortality among patients not taking antidepressants (aOR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.31-5.32; P = .03), and only a 6% increase in the odds of all-cause mortality among patients taking antidepressants (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.72-1.55; P = .99).

This research aims to assess and correlate the hyoid bone position, airway dimensions, and psychological status in class II Hz (horizontal) and Vt (vertical) malocclusion cases with TMD in contrast to non-TMD class I cases. Methodology This research was carried out at the Orthodontics Department, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Sawangi, with consent obtained from the ethical committee. A total of 63 adult patients with class I, class II horizontal, and class II vertical malocclusions were selected. TMD was diagnosed using the Helkimo index, and patients were categorized accordingly. Psychological status was evaluated using the Warwick-Edinburgh scale, while the placement of hyoid bone and airway dimensions were assessed using lateral cephalograms. Statistical analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS version 27.0, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results The research showed a noteworthy difference in the hyoid bone's location, airway dimensions, and psychological status among the three groups. Class II TMD patients (both vertical and horizontal) exhibited higher hyoid bone positions and larger Go-Hy-Me angles (angle formed by the gonion-hyoid line and the hyoid-menton line) compared to class I patients. In addition, class II vertical TMD patients showed the most reduced airway dimensions. Psychological assessments indicated higher stress, anxiety, and depression levels in class II TMD patients, particularly in the vertical group, compared to class I non-TMD patients. Conclusion This study highlights the intricate relationships between hyoid bone position, airway dimensions, and psychological status in TMD patients. TMD patients present with hyoid bones positioned closer to the cranium and mandible, larger Go-Hy-Me angles, and reduced airway dimensions. Psychological distress exacerbates TMD symptoms, negatively impacting overall well-being and quality of life. Orthodontists should consider these interrelated factors when devising treatment plans to improve patient outcomes. Future longitudinal studies with larger samples and advanced imaging techniques are recommended to further elucidate these interactions.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

Because older individuals are more likely to have multiple comorbidities or increased frailty, the impact of anxiety disorders on their overall well-being is exacerbated. Early identification of anxiety disorders using machine learning (ML) can potentially mitigate the adverse consequences associated with these disorders. We applied ML to the data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to predict the onset of anxiety disorders approximately three years in the future. We used Shapley value-based methods to determine the top factor for prediction. We also investigated whether anxiety onset can be predicted by baseline depression-related predictors alone. Our model was able to predict anxiety onset accurately (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve or AUC = 0.814 ± 0.016 (mean ± standard deviation), balanced accuracy = 0.741 ± 0.016, sensitivity = 0.743 ± 0.033, and specificity = 0.738 ± 0.010). The top predictive factors included prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis, high frailty, anxious personality, and low emotional stability. Depression and mood disorders are well known comorbidity of anxiety; however a prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis could not predict anxiety onset without other factors. While our findings underscore the importance of a prior depression diagnosis in predicting anxiety, they also highlight that it alone is inadequate, signifying the necessity to incorporate additional predictors for improved prediction accuracy.

We analyzed data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2016). The sample included 3496 individuals (59.9% female), aged ≥64 years old (M<sub>age</sub> = 76.0 ± 7.6 years in 2016).

Many participants experienced a significant early life (38%) or adulthood (79%) stressor. Moreover, experiencing one childhood adversity (vs. none) was associated with a 17.4% increased risk of adulthood adversity. Finally, as hypothesized, childhood adversity exposure was related to experiencing more depression and anxiety symptoms in later life, whereas adulthood stressor exposure predicted more cognitive impairment as well as more depression and anxiety symptoms. These findings demonstrate significant associations between lifetime adversity and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment in older adults.

Demographic information and self-reported psychiatric history before and after AIBD diagnosis were collected via self-report. Participants were 451 adults with AIBDs, recruited through the International Pemphigus and Pemphigoid Foundation newsletters, email distribution lists and social media. Participants reported increased incidence of psychiatric disorders following AIBD diagnosis. Participants reported high levels of depressive symptomatology and impairments to quality of life compared to other patient groups. The sample reported extremely high levels of body image disturbance, more so than other patients with disfiguring diseases or injury. Correlation analyses revealed significant relationships between body image variables and quality of life, even after controlling for depression. Current treatment guidelines for AIBDs focus primarily on the management of disease flares and the consequences of immunosuppression, without consideration of the psychosocial consequences of the disease. The current study underscores the need for mental health support for patients with AIBDs.", "confidence": {"accuracy_sure": true}}

To explore the perspectives of General Practice Nurses (GPNs) on the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a guided relaxation intervention for older people living with symptoms of anxiety, in Australian metropolitan and regional settings. GPNs were trained and then administered a guided relaxation intervention to older people at three metropolitan general practices and one large rural practice encompassing four sites. Subsequently, five GPNs participated in semi-structured interviews exploring the acceptability and feasibility of implementing the intervention. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and findings were mapped to four key domains of interest: \"Screening\", \"Training and Delivery\", \"Perceived impact of the Intervention\" and \"Barriers to the intervention\". Overall, GPNs reported that the intervention was easy to implement, was well received, helped build relationships and enabled conversations about mental health and well-being. They noted broader applicability of acquired knowledge and skills with other clients. The intervention shows promise in promoting and supporting healthcare capabilities in primary care.
